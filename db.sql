These monkeys were known to eat fruits, insects and even dirt, but nobody had reported them eating rats. â€œIt was funny,â€ says Holzner, â€œand disgusting.â€</p><p>This unexpected act occurred dozens of times from March to August 2016 as Holzner, of the University of Leipzig in Germany, and colleagues recorded what the macaques ate on oil palm plantations in northwest Peninsular Malaysia. To planters there, the macaques are pests.</p><p>Holzner did the work as part of the <a href="http://www.macaca-nemestrina.org/">Macaca Nemestrina Project</a> led by primate ecologist Nadine Ruppert of Universiti Sains Malaysia, in Penang. She presented the results on July 2 at the annual meeting of the <a href="http://atbc2018.org/">Association of Tropical Biology and Conservation</a> in Kuching, Malaysia.</p><p>While pig-tail macaques, <em>Macaca nemesterina</em>, spend most of their time in the forest, they visit adjacent plantations daily to forage, report Ruppert, Holzner and others in a related study in the April 4 <em>International Journal of Primatology</em>.</p><p>Holznerâ€™s new study shows that in the plantations, pig-tail macaques ate mostly oil palm fruits, spending only 1 percent of their meal times on rats. But the monkeys would peel open the bark on oil palm trunks to expose rats hiding within. The researchers estimate that a group of 30 macaques might eat as many as 2,080 rats in a year. Holznerâ€™s team counted fewer rats wherever they located macaques.</p><p>The study has local plantation owners reconsidering the monkeys, which may not be pests after all, but agents of rat control, Holzner says. But as macaques adapt to the encroaching plantations and their numbers grow, they can reduce birds and other creatures living in adjacent forests, warns ecologist Matthew Luskin at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.</p></span></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="field field-name-field-article-citation field-type-text-long field-label-above">       <div class="field-label">Citations</div>     <div class="field-items">           <div class="field-item even"><p>N.

On rat-free isles, there were on average 1,243 birds per hectare compared with about two birds per hectare on rat-infested islands, the team found. And these rodentless islands had healthier coral reef ecosystems. The secret: Bird poop, naturally rich in nitrogen, <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0202-3">washes into the ocean and helps keep reefs productive</a>, the scientists report in the July 12 <em>Nature</em>.</p><p>â€œWeâ€™re essentially linking three ecosystems in this study,â€ says study coauthor Nick Graham, an ecologist at Lancaster University in England. The rats affect the seabirds, which affect the reefs.</p><p>Introduced by humans to the Chagos Archipelago in the late 18th century, rats have since devastated native seabird populations, including red-footed boobies and terns. The rodents will eat seabird eggs, chicks and even the brains of adult birds, says Holly Jones, a restoration ecologist at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb who was not involved in the study. Rats are a major problem, Jones says, because seabirds are â€œecosystem engineers.â€ When theyâ€™re gone, the environment on land and in the water changes dramatically.</p><p></p><div class="lz-cont">   <img src="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/07/071118_LR_seabird_inline_1_370.jpg" data-echo="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/07/071118_LR_seabird_inline_1_370.jpg" alt="coral reef ecosystem" class="caption" style="width: 370px; height: 278px; float: right;" title="&lt;b&gt;IN DEEP WATER&lt;/b&gt;  Coral reefs near islands without invasive rats are healthier than those off rat-infested isles, likely due to an influx of more nutrients from bird poop.

Graham" /></noscript> </div> Bird poop, or guano, is rich in certain heavy nitrogen isotopes â€” different forms of the element with the same amount of protons but varying numbers of neutrons â€” which come from the animalsâ€™ diet. Graham and his colleagues tested for these isotopes on 12 islands, six with rat infestations and six that had no rats, and in nearby coral reefs.<p>Compared with rat-infested islands, the team found much more of the heavy nitrogen in the soil of rat-free islands, where bird populations still thrived, and in the algae, sponges and fish in reefs that surrounded those islands. Bird guano is known to leach into the sea in rainwater or lapping waves, but its effects on reefs has been unclear.</p><p>The researchers now suspect the reefs around rat-free islands are healthier in part because nitrogen can act as a fertilizer for ocean plants and algae. More algae grow, leading to more fish grazing on the reefs and helping clear out dead corals, essential processes for a healthy reef. The fish that lived near reefs with more nitrogen also grew larger and faster, the scientists showed.</p><p>In addition to these indirect effects on reefs, nitrogen may also directly help the corals, says David Gillikin, a biogeochemist at Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., who was not involved in the study. Between 15 and 50 percent of nitrogen found in corals comes directly from seabird guano, he says.</p><div class="inline-content inline-content-left clearfix" style="width:100%; float:none;"><h4>Trouble in paradise</h4><div class="inline-content-copy"><p>Comparisons of heavy nitrogen to light nitrogen show that there is a higher level of the heavy nitrogen, which is abundant in bird guano, in areas with no rats. Nitrogen levels were tested in island soil, algae and the muscles of a common reef fish called damselfish.</p><p></p><div class="lz-cont">   <img src="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/07/071118_LR_seabird_inline_2_730.png" data-echo="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/07/071118_LR_seabird_inline_2_730.png" alt="" class="caption" style="width: 730px; height: 454px;" title="~~ N.

Rat extermination has been done on 580 islands worldwide, with a success rate of about 85 percent.</p><p>Still, many coral reefs have been in trouble for decades and face various threats, including bleaching and ocean acidification, both <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-waves-are-roasting-reefs-some-corals-may-be-resilient">consequences of climate change</a> (<em>SN: 5/12/18, p. 20</em>).

is.</p><p>Monarch caterpillars, which feed on plants in the milkweed family, readily feast on <em>Asclepias curassavica</em>. Gardeners in the southern United States plant it for its showy orange blooms, yet the species â€œis turning out to be a bit of a nightmare,â€ says Mark Hunter of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.</p><p>Monarchs (<em>Danaus plexippus</em>) migrating south to Mexico in the fall come across bloodflower bonanzas and donâ€™t bother to keep on flying. Full migration normally prevents a harmful <em>Ophryocistis</em> parasite from building up in the insect population.

Caterpillars need these compounds to help fight parasites. Levels of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ele.13101">two particularly potent forms of cardenolide stayed low</a>.

That could turn the bloodflower species toxic to monarchs, according to a test growing milkweeds in enclosures with daytime temperatures raised some 3 degrees Celsius higher than outside air. A native milkweed, <em>A. incarnata</em>, didnâ€™t get close to toxic.</p><p>Researchers donâ€™t know how the opposing effects of CO<sub>2</sub> and heat might act on cardenolides overall. Regardless of how further research on that question turns out, bloodflowers are already a threat to monarchs. Hunter urges gardeners who canâ€™t resist growing the plants to at least cut them back in the fall, so that they wonâ€™t derail the monarch migration.</p><hr /><p><em>Editor\'s Note: This story was updated on July 11, 2018 to replace the top image with a picture of a monarch, not a queen butterfly.</em></p></span></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="field field-name-field-article-citation field-type-text-long field-label-above">       <div class="field-label">Citations</div>     <div class="field-items">           <div class="field-item even"><p>L.E.

But an analysis of fossils of sauropodomorphs â€” a group that includes sauropods and some ancestors and similarly shaped relatives â€” suggests that some of the dinos may have had <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-018-0599-y">a different strategy for becoming behemoths</a>, researchers report online July 9 in <em>Nature Ecology and Evolution</em>.</p><p>Paleontologist Cecilia Apaldetti of the Universidad Nacional de San Juan in Argentina and colleagues examined four sauropodomorphs, including one newly identified species that the team dubbed <em>Ingentia prima</em> and three already known specimens of a sauropodomorph called <em>Lessemsaurus sauropoides</em>. Dating to the Late Triassic, between 237 million and 201 million years ago, these â€œLessemsauridaeâ€ were far from puny: The animals weighed in at an estimated 7 to 10 metric tons, larger than an African elephant.</p><p>All four specimens showed a combination of features that was distinct from sauropods as well as from other sauropodomorphs. Instead of upright, pillarlike legs, the dinos had crouched hind limbs and flexed front limbs, with elbows splayed slightly outward. Patterns of bone growth in the fossils also suggest that the animals grew in cyclical spurts rather than continuously. However, their bone growth was extremely rapid, a feature unique to this group, Apaldetti says. â€œThey grew in a cyclical but extremely accelerated growth, at a speed even higher than that of the giants that grew continuously.â€</p><p>Like later sauropods, <em>I. prima</em> and <em>L. sauropoides</em> also appear to have had a birdlike respiratory system, the researchers found. Air sacs within the animalsâ€™ vertebrae provided large reserves of oxygenated air, helped keep their bodies cool despite their large size, and lightened the weight of their vertebrae.</p><p>Martin Sander, a vertebrate paleontologist at UniversitÃ¤t-Bonn in Germany, says that <em>I. prima</em> presents the best proof yet that these sauropodomorphs had this birdlike respiratory system, a fact that wasnâ€™t previously determined. However, he says he is not convinced that the Lessemsauridae were on a separate track toward gigantism. â€œFor me, itâ€™s more of an intermediate stage,â€ Sander says.</p><p>That sentiment is echoed by Jeffrey Wilson, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Lessemsauridae bone growth was cyclical, but that doesnâ€™t necessarily mean the cycles were seasonal; there may have been long time lags in between growth spurts, part of a transition to more sauropod-like growth patterns, Wilson says. â€œOne of the things I think future work will do is help resolve the ambiguity over whether the Lessemsauridae were taking their own adventure into gigantism.â€</p><p>The Lessemsauridae may have developed their growth strategy some 30 million years earlier than Jurassic sauropods, such as <em>Brachiosaurus</em> and <em>Diplodocus</em>, Apaldetti notes. But ultimately, the Jurassic giants â€œwere more successful,â€ she says â€” they outweighed the sauropodomorphs by as much as 60 tons, and outlasted them by tens of millions of years.</p></span></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="field field-name-field-article-citation field-type-text-long field-label-above">       <div class="field-label">Citations</div>     <div class="field-items">           <div class="field-item even"><p>C.

When she checked what the fishing vessels brought in, Barnes noticed two oddities. Male bigeye houndsharks greatly outnumbered females. And though males of this deepwater species are smaller than females, she saw immature males as large as female adults.

Even before opening the fish, she had pressed on the bellies of the "male"Â sharks and felt the pups inside.<p>â€œHermaphroditism is very uncommon in sharks,â€ says shark biologist Colin Simpdendorfer of James Cook University in Townsville, Australia. He calls Barnesâ€™ seven hermaphrodite sharks â€œone of the most unusual cases we have heard ofâ€ and says itâ€™s an obvious developmental anomaly. Scientists can still use claspers to identify male sharks, Simpdendorfer assures.</p><p>Barnesâ€™ finding isnâ€™t the first among sharks. A 2005 study in the <em>Journal of Fish Biology</em> reported <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.0022-1112.2005.00607.x">68 hermaphrodites among 80 longhead catsharks</a> (<em>Apristurus longicephalus</em>) from the Pacific and Indian Oceans. And surveys in the 1990s of bigeye houndsharks found more than 20 hermaphrodites among more than 60 sharks down the coast from where Barnes found hers.</p><p>With these other finds, Barnes is convinced â€œthere is something going onâ€ with the sharks. She suspects it might be pollutants in the water or hormonal changes â€” human-caused or otherwise â€” and is keen find out.</p></span></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="field field-name-field-article-citation field-type-text-long field-label-above">       <div class="field-label">Citations</div>     <div class="field-items">           <div class="field-item even"><p>A.

and Necessity of Bees</a><br /><em>Thor Hanson</em><br /><em>Basic Books, $27</em></p><p>When you hear the word <em>bee</em>, the image that pops to mind is probably a honeybee. Maybe a bumblebee. But for conservation biologist Thor Hanson, author of the new book <em>Buzz</em>, the world is abuzz with thousands of kinds of bees, each as beautiful and intriguing as the flowers on which they land.</p><p>Speaking from his â€œraccoon shackâ€ on San Juan Island in Washington â€” a backyard shed converted to an office and bee-watching space, and named for its previous inhabitants â€” Hanson shares what heâ€™s learned about how bees helped drive human evolution, the amazing birds that lead people to honey, and what a Big Mac would look like without bees. The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity.Â </p><p><b>SN: This bee book is unusual â€” it isnâ€™t mainly about honeybees. Why did you write about lesser-known bees?</b></p><p><strong>Hanson:</strong> I made a deliberate decision because I thought the celebrity bees, the honeybees, would steal the show. It was high time to turn a stage light onto these 20,000 other species of bees, which have habits that are less familiar but just as fascinating. For example, most people think of hives when they think of bees, but actually most bees are solitary.</p><p><b>SN: You write that this book is an â€œexploration of how the very nature of bees makes them so utterly necessary.â€ So letâ€™s cut to the chase: Why are bees necessary?</b></p><p><strong>Hanson:</strong> First is the deep connection between bees and flowering plants. Theyâ€™ve had a partnership from an early stage; each spurs the other in terms of diversity. Itâ€™s an incredible role that bees have played in shaping the natural world. Theyâ€™re also important to our lifestyle, first for their role in the human diet. Itâ€™s often said that one of every three bites of food depends on bees.</p><p>But there are all these other connections that we donâ€™t think about: Bees have provided light from beeswax candles and sweetness from honey. Early industrial uses of wax included making bronze sculptures with wax molds, batiks in Indonesia and wax tablets to write on.</p><p>You can trace our relationship with bees back not hundreds, but <em>hundreds of thousands</em> of years. The role of honey in the human diet goes back into prehistory. That source of sugar may have even helped fuel the expansion of our brain size. It may have helped us become who we are.</p><p></p><div class="lz-cont">   <img src="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/07/072118_reviews_buzz_inline_hanson_REV.jpg" data-echo="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/07/072118_reviews_buzz_inline_hanson_REV.jpg" alt="" class="caption" style="width: 730px; height: 548px; float: right;" title="&lt;b&gt;BEE WHISPERER&lt;/b&gt;  Thor Hanson, shown here catching bees for identification, wants people to appreciate the diversity and importance of bees.  ~~ Noah Hanson" /><noscript><img src="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/07/072118_reviews_buzz_inline_hanson_REV.jpg" alt="" class="caption" style="width: 730px; height: 548px; float: right;" title="&lt;b&gt;BEE WHISPERER&lt;/b&gt;  Thor Hanson, shown here catching bees for identification, wants people to appreciate the diversity and importance of bees.  ~~ Noah Hanson" /></noscript> </div> <p><b>SN: One of the most astonishing examples of our relationship with bees has to do with a bird called the honeyguide. Tell me about that.</b></p><p><strong>Hanson:</strong>Â <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/humans-birds-communicate-collaborate">Hunter-gatherers in Africa follow this bird to beesâ€™ nests</a>, and have for generations (<em>SN: 8/20/16, p. 10</em>). The honeyguide is very good at locating a hive. But on its own, it canâ€™t access the nest. So once it locates one, the next thing it does is look for people. It hops around on branches and makes a piercing cry to get attention, then leads a person to the honey. People climb the tree or dig out the nest, and honeyguides feed on the remains.</p><p>Whatâ€™s funny is how long it took biologists to figure out this relationship. The original explanation was that the honeyguide coevolved with the honey badger, which also raids nests for honey. Then a biologist pointed out that badgers are nocturnal, and the birds arenâ€™t. Also, no one has ever seen a honeyguide leading a badger. It makes more sense that the relationship evolved on the savannah with people out looking for honey every day.</p><p><b>SN: One of the bookâ€™s most hilariously geeky moments is when you go to McDonaldâ€™s and pick apart a Big Mac. Why did you do that?</b></p><p><strong>Hanson:</strong> I wanted to look for the significance of bees in an unexpected place. And you donâ€™t think of bees when you go into McDonaldâ€™s â€” you just donâ€™t! I didnâ€™t care how much people stared. I sat there with my tweezers, pulling all the seeds off the bun. I ended up with one pile you could have without bees [meat and bun] and one you couldnâ€™t [including not only the veggies, but also the cheese and special sauce]. We could still eat, but it would be pretty dull.</p><p><b>SN: Youâ€™re worried about bees. Why?</b></p><p><strong>Hanson:</strong> Itâ€™s the four pâ€™s: pesticides, pathogens, parasites and poor nutrition. Poor nutrition is one that people donâ€™t think of. We ship honeybees all over the place, and they get force-fed almond blossoms for three weeks, then theyâ€™re packed onto trucks and shipped off to pollinate apples. Itâ€™s not a healthy lifestyle, and not a varied diet.</p><p><b>SN: You say that bees are one of the few insects that inspire fondness instead of fear. Why do you think that is? </b></p><p><strong>Hanson:</strong> Bees have been with us from the beginning. Our primordial sweet tooth led us to follow these creatures, then we domesticated bees very early on, setting out hives and reusing good sites in baobab trees. I think we have a very deep connection to these creatures.</p><p><em>Buy </em><a href="https://amzn.to/2MUxBIm">Buzz: The Nature and Necessity of Bees</a><em> from Amazon.com. </em>Science News<em> is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program.

Under the right conditions, some spider species will climb to a high point, release silk strands to form a parachute, and float away on the breeze. Buoyed by air currents, theyâ€™ve been known to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-ignored-high-flying-arthropods-could-make-largest-land-migrations">drift kilometers above Earthâ€™s surface</a>, and even to cross oceans to reach new habitats (<em>SN: 2/4/17, p. 12</em>).</p><p>Now, new research suggests air isnâ€™t the only force behind this flight, called ballooning. Spiders can <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)30693-6">sense electrical charges in Earthâ€™s atmosphere</a>, and the forces exerted by these charges might be a cue for them to alight, researchers suggest July 5 in <em>Current Biology</em>. That invisible signal could help explain why spidersâ€™ take-off timing seem a bit, well, flighty. Some days, arachnids balloon en masse; other days, they remain firmly grounded despite similar weather conditions.</p><p>Spiders with atmospheric aspirations do need a gentle breeze with speeds below around 11 kilometers per hour, past studies have shown. But those speeds alone shouldnâ€™t be strong enough to get some of the larger species of ballooning spiders off the ground, says Erica Morley, a sensory biologist at the University of Bristol in England.</p><p></p><div class="lz-cont">   <img src="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/07/main/articles/070318_LH_ballooning-spiders_inline_730.jpg" data-echo="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/07/main/articles/070318_LH_ballooning-spiders_inline_730.jpg" alt="a scanning electron microscope image of the fine hairs on a spider leg" class="caption" style="width: 400px; height: 315px; float: right;" title="&lt;b&gt;GOOD HAIR DAY  &lt;/b&gt;Fine hairs on spidersâ€™ legs respond to moving air and, new research shows, the presence of an electric field.

Robert/&lt;em&gt;Curr Bio&lt;/em&gt; 2018" /></noscript> </div> So scientists have long wondered if some other force might be involved: Perhaps electrical charges in Earthâ€™s atmosphere push against the silken threads of airborne spidersâ€™ silk streamers to help them stay fanned out in a parachute. These electric charges form an electric field that attracts or repels other charged objects or particles. It varies in strength, becoming stronger around objects such as leaves and branches on trees, and also fluctuating with meteorological conditions.<p>In the first experimental test of whether spiders can sense these electric charges, Morley and Bristol sensory biologist Daniel Robert blocked out naturally occurring electric fields in a lab. They then created an artificial one mimicking what would-be arthropod aerialists would experience, and placed teeny-tiny spiders from the Linyphiidae family into that faux field. Under the electric field, even with no breeze, the spiders perched on the tips of their legs, a ballerina-like behavior that precedes ballooning. When the researchers switched off the artificial electric field, the behavior (which scientists call the â€œtiptoe stanceâ€) subsided.</p><p>Tiny hairs on the spidersâ€™ bodies react to both moving air and an electric fieldâ€™s presence, but differently, Morley found. The hairs stood on end as long as air was blowing on them. But when faced with an electric field, they stood on end most dramatically when the field was switched on and then gradually deflated to their resting position over about 30 seconds.</p><p>The study links the pre-ballooning tiptoeing behavior to the presence of an electric field, but actually taking off might require something more, suggests Moonsung Cho, an aerodynamics researcher at the Technical University of Berlin who wasnâ€™t involved in the study. While some spiders in the study did incidentally float away, that liftoff behavior wasnâ€™t actually measured.</p><p>And responding to electric fields probably isnâ€™t the full story when it comes take-off timing: A different genus of spider, <em>Xysticus</em>, or ground crab spiders, appears to sense wind speed with its legs before going aloft, <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004405">wiggling one spindly appendage around to sense moving air</a> and determine whether wind conditions are favorable for lift-off, Choâ€™s team reported June 14 in <em>PLOS Biology</em>.</p></span></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="field field-name-field-article-citation field-type-text-long field-label-above">       <div class="field-label">Citations</div>     <div class="field-items">           <div class="field-item even"><p>E.

Scientists injected preserved sperm from a male northern white rhino into eggs of female southern white rhinos, a closely related subspecies. The embryos were incubated until the cells begin to differentiate, a stage at which they can be implanted into a surrogate mother, researchers report July 4 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p><p>The new feat is â€œone of the really crucial stepsâ€ to eventually producing new rhino calves, says study coauthor Jan Stejskal, coordinator of northern white rhino conservation efforts at the Safari Park DvÅ¯r KrÃ¡lovÃ© in the Czech Republic. Eventually, researchers hope to implant similar embryos into female southern white rhinos or hybrid northern-southern white rhinos.</p><p>If it works, it could provide hope for bringing back a species on the brink of extinction. Sudan, the last male northern white rhino, died in March. Only two females remain in Kenya, both in captivity and unable to reproduce naturally. In comparison, there are more than 20,000 southern white rhinos left.</p><p>In the new study, the scientists used eggs from female southern white rhinos and sperm preserved from three male northern white rhinos. While the new embryos are a hybridized northern-southern white rhino mix, the ability to create them is â€œa saving mechanism for the genes of the northern white rhinos,â€ says study coauthor Thomas Hildebrandt, a reproduction biologist at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Berlin.</p><p></p><div class="lz-cont">   <img src="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/06/060318_LR_rhino-embryo_inline_730.jpg" data-echo="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/06/060318_LR_rhino-embryo_inline_730.jpg" alt="" class="caption" style="width: 730px; height: 360px;" title="&lt;b&gt;INCOMING&lt;/b&gt;  A scientist uses artificial reproductive technology to inject a northern white rhino sperm cell into a southern white rhino egg, creating one of the first rhino embryos in a lab. ~~ T.

They may be more compatible surrogate mothers for an eventual pure northern white rhino embryo since they will share more DNA with the babies. And theoretically, the hybrids could be selectively bred for the northern rhino genes, eventually creating a pure northern white rhino â€” a process that would take many generations and span multiple decades.</p><p>In a potentially quicker way to birth a pure northern white rhino, researchers plan to harvest eggs from the two remaining females and combine them with preserved northern white rhino sperm. If successful, a northern white rhino calf could be born within the next three years, Hildebrandt says.</p><p>Stem cell technology may play an important role in saving the rhinos, too. The team was able to derive pluripotent stem cells, which can turn into any cell in the body including eggs and sperm, from two pure southern white embryos. Hildebrandt says that there are 12 frozen cell lines from northern white rhinos, six of which are genetically distinct â€“ important for avoiding inbreeding. If researchers can turn these skin cells first into pluripotent stem cells and then eggs and sperm, it would be another way to create a pure northern white rhino embryo.</p><p>For now, other scientists caution against too much optimism. â€œSaving a species or a subspecies takes a lot more than the science,â€ says Terri Roth, an animal reproductive physiologist at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden. Africa is in the midst of a rhino-poaching epidemic, she says. In 2013, poachers killed 13 rhinos; in 2017, over 1,000 were killed. Any <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/protecting-wildlife-legal-hunting-complicated-issue">efforts to reestablish the northern white rhino population</a> will need to address this crisis, she says (<em>SN Online: 12/16/13</em>).</p><p>Hildebrandt agrees. The northern white rhino didnâ€™t go extinct because it failed at evolution, he says, â€œit failed because it is not bulletproof.â€</p></span></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="field field-name-field-article-citation field-type-text-long field-label-above">       <div class="field-label">Citations</div>     <div class="field-items">           <div class="field-item even"><p>T.

We are thrilled to share an edited version of their conversation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You&rsquo;re an alumna of the 1975 International Science and Engineering Fair. How did the competition impact your life and are there any particular moments that still stand out for you? </strong></p><p>It was an amazing experience. In 1975, I became fascinated by holograms &mdash; I just thought they were magic. Although holograms are everywhere now, at the time they were not that well known. [Note: Johnson&rsquo;s project title was &ldquo;Holographic Study of the Sporangiophore of <em>Phycomyces</em>.&rdquo;]</p><p>I ended up building a little lab in our basement and was able to reproduce the lab in my physics classroom at school. That&rsquo;s the year I experienced my first all-nighter. I stayed up all night at my high school the night before the science fair. It was a little controversial to say the least.</p><p>My project did well, and it was exciting. As a result, I think competing at ISEF gave me confidence and enthusiasm about science.</p><p>At the time, I was really not aware that it was unusual to be a woman in science. It wasn&rsquo;t until I went to college that I realized that it was unusual. That&rsquo;s where doing well at ISEF gave me confidence. When I was told I didn&rsquo;t belong, I could just think back to succeeding at ISEF.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><img alt="Kristina Johnson Chancellor, The State University of New York. Photo courtesy ofÂ State University of New York." class="caption" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/images/SUNY_CKJohnson_4287-Medium.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 375px; float: left;" title="Kristina Johnson Chancellor, The State University of New York. ~~ Photo courtesy ofÂ State University of New York." />I understand your high school did not have a girls&rsquo; lacrosse team so you practiced with the boys. At Stanford University, you started a women&rsquo;s lacrosse team that became the varsity team. We still experience a gender gap in a variety of fields, from athletics to engineering. What strategies do you think are working and not working to close the gender gap? </strong></p><p>Obviously, the biggest improvement for gender equity in sports was passing Title IX, wherein it became important to open up these opportunities for girls and women. When I got to Stanford, I learned that we didn&rsquo;t have a lacrosse team and thought, well, we should start one. So, we did. Over the course of my nearly eight years at Stanford as an undergraduate and graduate student, it went from being a club sport to a club varsity sport. I think that&rsquo;s maybe part of the answer: Leaders need to take charge when they see an opportunity to build something new. [Note: On the 40th anniversary of Title IX in 2012, Johnson was recognized as a 40 For 40 honoree by espnW and other organizations. The 40 For 40 event honored &ldquo;women who have made an impact&rdquo; after participating in high school and college sports.]</p><p>When I went into science and engineering at Stanford, I didn&rsquo;t have any science or engineering faculty that were women. I only had two women professors in eight years. Only two, though I had terrific male faculty including my Ph.D. adviser, Joseph Goodman. When I graduated, I did not think that women were professors in science and engineering. I didn&rsquo;t really think too much about it. It just was the way it was. One of the things that I&rsquo;m not as happy about today is that there hasn&rsquo;t been a significant increase in the number of women pursuing engineering. That needs to change.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Drawing on your experiences as chancellor of the SUNY system, dean of engineering at Duke University, an entrepreneur and a high-level government appointee in the Obama administration, what particular challenges do you think are keeping women in the sciences back? </strong></p><p>In the early 1990s, the National Science Foundation did an interesting study that said women will pursue careers in science and engineering and stay in them if they can align their vocation with their avocation to help others.</p><p>I think the more that we humanize the field, the more attractive these careers will be to all individuals.</p><p>I also think part of it is that when women don&rsquo;t see role models in their classrooms, they don&rsquo;t know they can do it. I&rsquo;m very passionate about bringing underrepresented minorities and women into the professoriate and the academy so we can inspire a new generation of diverse leaders. I think part of it really is when you are &ldquo;other,&rdquo; it is important to feel welcome.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You&rsquo;ve reportedly said that there are three things you would never do. One is be a dean, two is start a company and three is write a book. You&rsquo;ve done two out of three. I&rsquo;m curious as to what has motivated you to take different turns in your career. </strong></p><p>So, it is true. I did say I never wanted to be a dean. I never wanted to start a company. I didn&rsquo;t want to write a book. I actually haven&rsquo;t written a book yet, but I have a title for a book. I was thinking just yesterday I probably need to write it. So, stay tuned on that one.</p><p>I wanted to become a dean because leadership to me is common sense. I felt that if I could make the lives better for my fellow faculty members, that I could have a bigger impact and just make it better for all.</p><p>When I was a young professor, we established an engineering research center. I helped cowrite the grant. As part of the grant, there was an expectation that we were going to create a new workforce and new industries. I took that mission very seriously, which led me to leave academia and try to create those new companies, products, processes and a different kind of educated workforce.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Did you enjoy your time as undersecretary of energy at the U.S. Department of Energy? </strong></p><p>You know, I did like it. It was a very intense period of time. Maybe it was because we had to invest $37 billion in energy and environment investments from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in addition to the broad $11 billion energy and environment portfolio. It was an honor to work for the Department of Energy. Every single individual I worked with was committed. We worked every weekend, every evening, to try and get funding out, so that we could create jobs, put people back to work and lower our greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>While you were at Duke you created a fellowship that supported about a third of undergraduates so that they could spend 18 months doing research in labs. Are you thinking of similar things at SUNY, or are there any plans to partner with New York high schools to promote STEM education?</strong></p><p>When I was at Duke, I saw that a lot of our engineering students were going to New York to join the financial industry, which is fine. But I thought it also would be great to introduce our students to a broader array of opportunities.</p><p>The program, called the Pratt Research Fellows, has students start work in research labs during the spring of their junior year, including the summer and all during their senior year. When those kids graduated, they were going to the financial sector, but they were also going on to graduate schools. It was exciting because they really caught the bug of innovation. So, yes, I&rsquo;d like to start that at SUNY.</p><p>We&rsquo;re also very excited about trying to link SUNY with high schools. One of the exciting things about SUNY is it&rsquo;s the largest comprehensive university system in the country. We have high schools that we charter. We have 30 community colleges. We have 13 comprehensive, unique four-year institutions with master&rsquo;s programs. We have technical-focused two- and four-year schools. Then, we have 14 doctoral-granting degree institutions, including five medical schools and three hospitals.</p><p>During my first State of the University System Address, I discussed four themes across our broad intellectual ecosystem. First, innovation and entrepreneurship. The second, individualized education. Third, energy and sustainability, and fourth, partnerships. Creating programs where all of our students are doing research and innovation together &mdash; I think that is very exciting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What advice do you have for young people just starting their higher education or careers?</strong></p><p>Get everything you can out of it. I played sports. I &ldquo;hashed&rdquo; at the French house to keep up my French. I worked in the labs. When you start in higher ed, it&rsquo;s important to find an area that you can carve out outside the classroom. I recommend that students look up faculty with similar interests and make an appointment and ask to work with the faculty member as an independent study student.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What books are you reading now? </strong></p><p>So, there&rsquo;s a book George Packer wrote called <em>The Unwinding</em>, which talks about Youngstown when Delphi left and the real estate crash in Tampa.

A large team of researchers <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0153-5">published the detailed look at the koala genome</a> online July 2 in <em>Nature Genetics.</em></p><p><strong>Why do we care?</strong> Lots of people love koalas. The iconic animal draws at least $1.1 billion in Australian dollars in tourism every year, according to the New South Wales government. But the number of koalas in the wild is declining, and researchers are combing the genome for clues about how to save the creatures.</p><p>Already, scientists have found that some koala populations are less genetically diverse than others. The genetic diversity survey also showed that koalas from different sides of some geographic barriers donâ€™t mix often. Brisbane Valley and the Clarence River were already known to separate koala populations, but the new study found that a region called Hunter Valley is a barrier, too. Armed with that knowledge, conservationists may be able to devise new strategies for limiting inbreeding and keeping koalas genetically diverse.</p><p><strong>How many genes does a koala have?</strong> 26,558. Researchers had previously counted only about 15,000 koala genes, but new techniques allowed scientists find more.</p><p><strong>Is that a lot?</strong> Yes, depending on what organism youâ€™re comparing it with. Thatâ€™s more than <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/29/332825">the newest estimate</a> of 21,306 protein-producing genes in humans. But plants often have thousands more genes than animals do.</p><p>The koalaâ€™s genome is also bigger than the human genome. Humans have about 6.4 billion DNA base pairs (the chemical building blocks of DNA); koalas have about 7 billion DNA base pairs.</p><p></p><div class="lz-cont">   <img src="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/06/062918_TS_koala-genome_inline_370.jpg" data-echo="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/06/062918_TS_koala-genome_inline_370.jpg" alt="" class="caption" style="float: right; width: 370px; height: 493px;" title="&lt;b&gt;SLEEPY TIME&lt;/b&gt;  Koalas, like this female at Featherdale Wildlife Park in Sydney, spend most of their time sleeping, resting and eating. ~~ Rebecca Johnson" /><noscript><img src="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/06/062918_TS_koala-genome_inline_370.jpg" alt="" class="caption" style="float: right; width: 370px; height: 493px;" title="&lt;b&gt;SLEEPY TIME&lt;/b&gt;  Koalas, like this female at Featherdale Wildlife Park in Sydney, spend most of their time sleeping, resting and eating. ~~ Rebecca Johnson" /></noscript> </div> <strong>What else does the study reveal?</strong> Koalas eat eucalyptus, which makes toxic chemicals called terpenes. Eating eucalyptus would kill most other animals, but koalas have doubled up on detox genes, especially <em>CYP2C</em>-type genes. The extra copies of these genes make proteins in koala livers that break down terpenes into water-soluble molecules that can be flushed out of the body. Unfortunately, those genes may also break down the antibiotics used to treat koalas infected with chlamydia, a major health threat contributing to the decline of the species.<p>The study also sheds light on why koalas are such picky eaters. Even though there are more than 600 species of eucalyptus, koalas dine on only about 20. It turns out that koalas have 24 bitter taste receptor genes â€” useful for detecting terpenes and other toxic chemicals â€” more than any other type of Australian marsupial. Koalas also have six times as many genes involved in smell as other marsupials do. Together, the smell and taste genes may help koalas select species of eucalyptus with the most nutrients and fewest toxins.</p><p>Koalas also have dual copies of the aquaporin 5 gene, which may help the animals seek out the most succulent eucalyptus leaves. Most of a koalaâ€™s water intake comes from the leaves.</p><p><strong>Fun facts: </strong>On average, koalas spend 14.5 hours a day sleeping. Resting while awake takes up about four to eight hours. Eating consumes another four to seven hours. Only four minutes of the day is spent traveling.</p><p>Koalas have proteins in their milk that may help protect baby koalas in their mothersâ€™ pouches from chlamydia and other bacterial or fungal infections.</p></span></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="field field-name-field-article-citation field-type-text-long field-label-above">       <div class="field-label">Citations</div>     <div class="field-items">           <div class="field-item even"><p>R.N.

But the stubborn spirochete has refused to thrive any place outside of a human or rabbit for more than 18 days. That doesnâ€™t give researchers much time to study it.</p><p>â€œIâ€™ve basically spent my entire career watching these organisms die,â€ says microbiologist Steven Norris, of the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. Until now. Norris and colleagues have cooked up <a href="https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.01153-18">a new recipe that keeps the bacteria alive for months</a>, they report June 26 in <em>mBio</em>.</p><p>â€œWe know very little about the organism,â€ Norris says. Being able to study it long-term in a dish could lead to better treatments for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cdc-sounds-alarm-stds">the millions infected worldwide</a> and pave the way for the development of a vaccine to prevent the sexually transmitted disease (<em>SN: 11/26/16, p.5</em>).</p><p>The first ingredient, rabbit epithelial cells, was <a href="http://iai.asm.org/content/32/2/908.full.pdf">adapted from a 1981 method</a> that managed to grow the bacteria for about two weeks. But it needed a secret sauce, a medium that would encourage the bacteria to grow within the rabbit cells.</p><p>First, the team tried â€œthe kitchen sink approach,â€ testing between 10 and 20 mixes of nutrients and additives. No luck.</p><p>Then, inspiration â€” from the bacteria that causes Lyme disease â€” struck. Although <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> and <em>T. pallidum</em> behave differently and cause different diseases, the two have similar spiral structures. Maybe they would grow in the same medium. That logic paid off. CMRL 1066, a brothy complex of sugars and vitamins favored by the Lyme spirochete, has helped keep <em>T. pallidum </em>alive for almost eight months, Norris says.</p><p>Each week, he gets a thrill as he moves the multiplying bacteria to a fresh version of the medium. â€œItâ€™s still a surprise to us that the organisms are growing,â€ he says.</p></span></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="field field-name-field-article-citation field-type-text-long field-label-above">       <div class="field-label">Citations</div>     <div class="field-items">           <div class="field-item even"><p>D.G.

height: 226px; float: left;" /></noscript> </div> </strong>Spying on Whales</a><br /><em>Nick Pyenson</em><br /><em>Viking, $27</em></p><p>Just before humans evolved, whales and dolphins were, pound for pound, the brainiest creatures on Earth. Another cetacean superlative: Todayâ€™s biggest whales are heftier than the largest dinosaurs that ever lived. The evolutionary trends that produced big, brainy marine animals are just a few of the fascinating tales told in <em>Spying on Whales.</em></p><p>Paleontologist Nick Pyenson studies whale fossils, but heâ€™s also been known to cut up a few modern-day carcasses. As laid out in his new science-book-cum-midcareer-memoir, the anatomical info gained from both endeavors provides strong evidence for evolution in action. That process has transformed cetaceansâ€™ dog-sized, four-legged ancestors, which returned to the water around 50 million years ago, into todayâ€™s seafaring behemoths. Pyensonâ€™s research hasnâ€™t been all lab work, though: His field studies have taken him from whaling stations in Iceland to a site in South Americaâ€™s Atacama Desert where <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/algal-blooms-created-ancient-whale-graveyard?mode=magazine&amp;context=197053">ancient whales repeatedly washed ashore</a> (<em>SN Online: 2/28/14</em>).</p><p>Blue whales are about 10,000 times as massive as their landlubber ancestors, Pyenson notes. One evolutionary innovation that enabled the immensity of blue whales and some of their close kin is baleen, the flexible sheets of fingernail-like keratin that hang by the hundreds from the roofs of these creaturesâ€™ toothless mouths. Using these frayed and overlapping sheets, baleen whales filter immeasurable numbers of tiny prey from mouthfuls of water the volume of a large living room.</p><p>For some baleen whale species, another undoubted asset is the sensory organ that Pyenson and colleagues discovered in the â€œchinsâ€ of fin whales, among others. That nerve-rich glob of goo helps the whales sense dense clouds of prey and better recognize the position of their own jaws as they open and close their mouths.</p><p>When Pyenson looks to whalesâ€™ future, thereâ€™s mixed news. Most countries have phased out commercial whaling, but collisions with ships still threaten cetaceansâ€™ long-term survival. On the other hand, Pyenson notes, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-sea-ice-loss-top-science-stories-2016?mode=magazine&amp;context=197053">a decline in summer sea ice in the Arctic</a> may be allowing gray whales to stray over the pole from the North Pacific to the North Atlantic and beyond, possibly setting up new populations (<em>SN: 12/24/16, p. 23</em>).</p><p>All in all, <em>Spying on Whales</em> is a delight to read, from the authorâ€™s descriptions of the sights, sounds and smells of the lab and field to the joys of hunting fossils, whether with his colleagues or his young son.</p><p><i>Buy </i><a href="https://amzn.to/2tEfs9M">Spying on Whales</a><i>Â from Amazon.com.Â </i>Science News<i>Â is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program.

As an entomologist at the Hunterdon County Health Services in Flemington, N.J., heâ€™s the person to talk to about all things mosquitoes and ticks. But he had never seen anything like the infestation on a pet sheep in September 2017.</p><p>When he and his colleague entered the sheepâ€™s enclosure, â€œwe almost immediately got covered in ticks,â€ he says. â€œI couldnâ€™t believe this sheep was alive.â€ It was covered in hundreds, maybe thousands, of ticks.</p><p>Unable to identify the ticks, Rainey sent samples to labs across the country. One went to Andrea Egizi, an entomologist at Rutgers School of Environmental and Biological Sciences in New Brunswick, N.J. Egizi analyzed the tickâ€™s DNA, and was shocked when the identification came back as <em>Haemaphysalis longicornis</em>, a native of East Asia.</p><p>Known as <a href="https://www.smsl.co.nz/site/southernmonitoring/files/NZB/Ha%20longicornis%20Profile.pdf">the longhorned tick</a> or bush tick, <em>H. longicornis </em>is ubiquitous in Japan, China and the Korean Peninsula. The New Jersey sheep was the first documented sighting in the continental United States, say Rainey and Egizi, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jme/article/55/3/757/4840594">who published their findings online</a> February 19 in the <em>Journal of Medical Entomology</em>.</p><p>Scientists say that it is rare to find an invasive tick species in the wild. And this one seems to be spreading. It has been discovered in at least three more states â€” Virginia, West Virginia and Arkansas â€” and warnings have been issued for Maryland.Â </p><p>Here are five reasons why scientists are keeping an eye on this sneaky invader.</p><h4>1. This tick can clone itself.</h4><p>After a female longhorned tick feeds, she will lay up to 2,000 genetically identical eggs. Two to three months later, the eggs hatch without any male fertilization, and become mini copies of their mom. It is unclear how many ticks practice this rare form of asexual reproduction called parthenogenesis; so far, scientists have found fewer than 20 that reproduce this way, out of more than 800 tick species worldwide.</p><p>The process is â€œpretty alarming,â€ says medical entomologist Neeta Connally at West Connecticut State University in Danbury. Thatâ€™s because parthenogenesis happens faster than traditional mating â€” about six months for the longhorned tick, compared with the two-year reproduction cycle of common American ticks such as the deer tick and lone star tick.Â  Researchers worry that this rapid cloning could lead to heavier tick infestations in short periods of time. The female longhorned tick can focus on feeding, reproducing and traveling, without worrying about finding a mate. â€œSheâ€™s one of the first feminists,â€ jokes Allen Heath, a parasitologist at the Hopkirk Research Institute in Palmerston North, New Zealand.</p><h4>2. Itâ€™s not a picky eater.</h4><p></p><div class="lz-cont">   <img src="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/06/062718_lr_tick_sheep_inline_370.jpg?mode=topic&amp;context=76" data-echo="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/06/062718_lr_tick_sheep_inline_370.jpg?mode=topic&amp;context=76" alt="" class="caption" style="float: right; width: 370px; height: 290px;" title="&lt;b&gt;GETTING AN EARFUL&lt;/b&gt; Hundreds of ticks in all stages of life were found latched on to the ear of a sheep in New Jersey. ~~Tadhgh Rainey/Hunterdon Country Health Services" /><noscript><img src="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/06/062718_lr_tick_sheep_inline_370.jpg?mode=topic&amp;context=76" alt="" class="caption" style="float: right; width: 370px; height: 290px;" title="&lt;b&gt;GETTING AN EARFUL&lt;/b&gt; Hundreds of ticks in all stages of life were found latched on to the ear of a sheep in New Jersey. ~~Tadhgh Rainey/Hunterdon Country Health Services" /></noscript> </div> Some ticks, like the rabbit tick or moose tick, have specialized hosts and wonâ€™t feed on other animals. Other ticks, like the longhorned tick, rarely meet a blood type they donâ€™t like. The longhorned tick will chow down on any bird or mammal it can get its hooks into â€” <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-ticks-get-under-your-skin?mode=topic&amp;context=76">including humans</a> (<em>SN: 11/16/13</em>).<h4>3. It can carry human diseases.</h4><p>While no human bites have been reported in the United States yet, the longhorned tick is a significant public health threat in its native East Asia. In China, Japan and Korea, the tick is a known carrier of several viruses and bacteria that can infect humans. Recently, it has been linked to a disease called severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), which causes severe hemorrhaging and has a mortality rate of more than 5 percent.Â </p><p>SFTS isnâ€™t in the United States, but researchers worry that the longhorned tick may be able to adapt to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ticks-here-stay-scientists-finding-ways-outsmart-bloodsuckers?mode=topic&amp;context=76">transmit local tick-borne diseases</a>. Of particular concern is Lyme disease, but other potentially fatal diseases that cause neurological problems are also worrying, including ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Powassan virus (<em>SN: 9/16/17, p. 8</em>).Â </p><h4>4.Â  Itâ€™s a big threat to livestock.</h4><p>At least for now, it seems cows and sheep should be more afraid of the tick than people. The longhorned tick is great at transmitting the deadly cattle disease theileriosis. Heavy infestations of the critters have also been known to suck so much blood from a single animal that it dies, a vampiric practice called exsanguination.</p><p>â€œKeep an eye on your animals,â€ warns Denise Bonilla, an entomologist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Inspection Service in Fort Collins, Colo. Farmers in affected areas should keep their animals on tick treatments if needed, she says.</p><h4>5. This tick is probably more widespread than we realize.</h4><p>Researchers have no idea how the tick got to the United States, or how itâ€™s been traveling within the country. Theories include hitching rides on birds or horses. We do know the tick had been in the country for several years before it was discovered last September. After that, a Rutgers graduate student tested an old tick from a 2013 sample found in New Jersey. It also turned out to be a longhorned tick, misidentified at the time as a native rabbit tick. The similar-looking longhorned tick and rabbit tick are from the same <em>Haemaphysalis </em>genus.</p><p>Egizi says she is not surprised the longhorned tick has been found in multiple places, considering it had gone undetected for years. â€œThe more we look for it, the more weâ€™ll find it,â€ she says.</p></span></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="field field-name-field-article-citation field-type-text-long field-label-above">       <div class="field-label">Citations</div>     <div class="field-items">           <div class="field-item even"><p>T.

One added benefit: It&rsquo;s nontoxic. Key to the new wallpaper is a network of nanowires inside it. The wires are made from hydroxyapatite, a mineral found in bones and teeth that is flexible on a nanoscale level. Researchers in China described their new wall covering March 13 in <em>ACS Nano</em>.

Today, he is best known for discovering a drab animal no larger than a sesame seed. The animal had been hiding in one of Schulze&rsquo;s fish tanks. To this day, <em>Trichoplax adhaeren</em>s remains the simplest animal known. A flat sheet three cells thick, it has no mouth, stomach, muscles, blood or veins. Yet <em>T. adhaerens </em>interests scientists because it shows what the very first animals on Earth might have looked like.

Pollutants too small to see can alter brain function. The pollutants can make it hard for kids to concentrate and can throw hormones &mdash; those chemical messengers that direct the body&rsquo;s activities &mdash; out of whack. In short, air pollution can seriously damage young minds and bodies. And over many years, scientists worry, these pollutants could place healthy young people at risk of developing high blood pressure, diabetes or even heart disease and strokes. <em>&mdash; Lindsey Konkel</em></p><p><strong>Read more: <a href="http://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/dirty-air">www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/dirty-air</a></strong></p>  '),

After all, a few species today live with theirs swaddled safely up by the kidneys, like elephants do. Most other mammals drop their testes to the lower abdomen to a spot under the skin â€” like seals â€” or into an extra-abdominal sack called the scrotum â€” like humans. What style came first has been a topic of debate.</p><p>Now, new research on the genetic underpinnings of testes locations suggests that the male ancestor of placental mammals <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005293">sported one of the descended modes</a>. â€œFor sure, the [ancestorâ€™s] testes wouldnâ€™t be close to the kidneys,â€ says Michael Hiller, a computational biologist at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics in Dresden, Germany.</p><p>The evidence comes from comparing the genetic instruction books, or genomes, of 71 mammalian species, scientists report June 28 in <em>PLOS Biology</em>. Hiller, a coauthor of the study, says the team wasnâ€™t looking for DNA evidence of ancient testicles, but kept seeing broken versions of two genes, <em>INSL3</em> and <em>RXFP2</em>, popping up just in the lineage that includes golden moles and manatees. These genetic fossils, vestiges of once active code, suggested that certain Afrotherians, a grouping of mammals that includes elephant shrews, aardvarks and elephants, had lost <em>something</em>.</p><p>Those genes program the development of the gubernaculum, a ligament that holds dropped testes. â€œ[Itâ€™s] necessary for testicular descent to happen,â€ Hiller says. As it turns out, all of the species with nonfunctioning versions of the two genes also had undescended testes. â€œYou only see remnants of the genes required for testicular descent in species with no descent. The only way to explain that is that this is an ancestral trait that was later lostâ€ in these species, Hiller says. Otherwise, the genetic fossils shouldnâ€™t exist.</p><p>Hiller doesnâ€™t think that there was one Afrotherian ancestor that lost descended testes and passed on the trait to subsequent species in its lineage. Rather, because different Afrotherians have different <em>INSL3</em> and <em>RXFP2</em> mutations, the shift happened at different times for different species, he says. Rock hyraxes and elephants still have completely intact copies of the genes but no descended testicles, for instance. Hiller says that means the animals probably lost the trait relatively recently.</p><p>Rock hyraxes and elephants may still use the genes for some other function. â€œSometimes genes have multiple functions. If one [function] is no longer necessary, that doesnâ€™t mean the gene will become inactivated,â€ says Mark Springer, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Riverside. Itâ€™s also possible that thereâ€™s another, shared mutation in a third gene that inactivates testicular descent that researchers havenâ€™t spotted yet, he says.</p><p></p><div class="lz-cont">   <img src="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/06/main/062818_AC_testicles_feat.jpg?mode=topic&amp;context=76" data-echo="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/06/main/062818_AC_testicles_feat.jpg?mode=topic&amp;context=76" alt="an African bull elephant" class="caption" style="width: 730px; height: 390px;" title="&lt;b&gt;OUT OF SIGHT&lt;/b&gt;  Male elephants like this African bull elephant do not drop their testes in their body during development.

Rather, their testes rest up by their kidneys. ~~ Bebedi/iStockphoto" /></noscript> </div> <p>Still, Springer says he applauds the study authors. Such genetic sleuthing is one way to tackle the evolution of soft body parts that donâ€™t preserve well in the fossil record. â€œThe study attacked this problem from a new angle we havenâ€™t seen before,â€ Springer says. But whether that ancestorâ€™s descended testes rested in a scrotum or in the lower abdomen under the skin â€œis still an open question.â€</p><p>Somewhat surprising, too, is why a species would evolve to have its testicles in such a vulnerable position. â€œCan you imagine having descended ovaries in a thin, unprotected sack?â€ asks Gordon Gallup, an evolutionary psychologist at the University at Albany in New York who has studied testicular evolution â€œItâ€™s unthinkable. Itâ€™s equally unthinkable for testes. Protection of the gonads is paramount.â€</p><p>But sperm need a signal telling them theyâ€™re in a female reproductive organ. That signal is temperature, Gallup says. Sperm begin swimming vigorously when the heat goes up â€” when, say, they move from a cool descended testicle into a warm vagina.</p><p>Before descended testicles evolved, Gallup thinks that the temperature signal came largely from a rise in female body temperatures during ovulation. â€œItâ€™s referred to by vets as an animal in heat,â€ he says. Keeping semen stored a bit cooler would make that change in body temperature more dramatic and help activate the sperm even more after coitus, Gallup says. â€œThat may have led to the evolution of descended testicles in the first place,â€ he says. â€œIt makes for a much more efficient use of semen.â€</p><p>At least two of the species with undescended testicles have work-arounds. Both tenrecs and golden moles keep their body temperatures below 37Â° Celsius, the cutoff temp for good sperm storage. And elephantsâ€™ and rock hyraxesâ€™ sperm ductwork detours close to the bodyâ€™s surface, which may act as a cooling mechanism. Researchers may soon get on the ball with exploring those mysteries.</p></span></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="field field-name-field-article-citation field-type-text-long field-label-above">       <div class="field-label">Citations</div>     <div class="field-items">           <div class="field-item even"><p>V.

The leprosy bacterium can live in peopleâ€™s noses and may be shed in droplets when a person sneezes, coughs or breathes.</p><p>About 95 percent of the global population is immune to leprosy. But among those who are susceptible, itâ€™s not entirely clear how some get infected. Many people newly diagnosed with the disease say they never met anyone else who had leprosy, says Richard Truman, a leprosy researcher at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. Although the infection may take years to produce symptoms, people might remember encountering someone with the disease because transmission of leprosy seems to require close, long-term contact with an infected person, such as living with a family member. The source of those peopleâ€™s leprosy is a mystery.</p><p>Truman and colleagues reported in 2011 that nine-banded armadillos in the southeastern United States <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/armadillos-may-spread-leprosy?mode=topic&amp;context=87">carry the same strain of leprosy as people do</a> (<em>SN: 5/21/11, p. 9</em>), suggesting that people were being infected after contact with the burrowing animals. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/british-red-squirrels-serve-leprosy-reservoir?mode=topic&amp;context=87">Red squirrels in Great Britain</a> and some amoebae are the only other creatures known to harbor <em>M. leprae</em>. After the armadillo link was discovered in the United States, researchers wondered whether the animals were also contributing to the problem in Brazil. Several studies came up with mixed results.</p><p>The new research examined 16 armadillos that residents of SÃ£o Jorge and Corpus Christi had hunted in the forests surrounding the villages. Spencer and colleagues found <em>M. leprae</em> DNA in the spleens of 10 of the armadillos, and bacteria in some of the animalsâ€™ tissues. As for people, of 146 villagers, 96 had handled or cooked armadillo meat. And 91 people reported eating armadillo within the last year, with 27 of those people saying that they ate armadillo more than once a month. Those frequent armadillo eaters were at slightly higher risk of contracting the disease than people who didnâ€™t dine on armadillo, the team found.</p><p>Armadillo hunters were particularly threatened. Their risk of getting leprosy was nearly seven times greater than normal, the researchers say.</p><p>The evidence suggests that, people who come into frequent contact with armadillos may catch leprosy from the animals, Truman says. But to really establish the connection, researchers would need to show that the <em>M. leprae</em> bacteria in the armadillos are the same strains as those infecting people.</p><p>Getting a diagnosis of leprosy provokes anxiety in many patients, Truman says. â€œMany fear they are cursed and fear how their families will survive the stigma of the disease.â€ But understanding that the disease can come from something common like armadillos may help allay those fears and erase stigma. â€œThis gives them a plausible biological explanation for their disease,â€ he says.</p><p>Spencer isnâ€™t sure that his findings will stop people from hunting and eating armadillos. When he and his team told villagers they could get leprosy from armadillos, â€œthey said, â€˜we donâ€™t care. We love to eat them.â€™ It wasnâ€™t going to change their behavior,â€ Spencer recalls.

These high-pressure injections have been identified as likely culprits in earthquakes near enhanced geothermal plants in Switzerland as well.</p><p>But Hawaiiâ€™s geothermal power plant doesnâ€™t require any high-pressure injections; its location next to a volcano is no accident. The subsurface there is already fractured and very hot, well-suited for geothermal power generation, Gramling says. In other words, injections didnâ€™t cause Kilauea to erupt.</p><h4>Break it down</h4><p><em>Researchers created a new kind of plastic polymer that could, in theory, be infinitely recyclable, Laurel Hamers reported in â€œ<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plastic-polymer-recyclable?mode=magazine&amp;context=197053">This plastic can be recycled over and over and over again</a>â€ (</em>SN: 5/26/18, p. 12<em>). </em></p><p>Online reader Mark S. wondered how the plastic could be commercialized.</p><p>â€œWithout an easy way to separate recyclable plastic from the mass of nonrecyclable plastic, it doesnâ€™t seem like there would be much [of a] market,â€ he wrote. He suggested embossing the new plastic with a bar code that would allow an artificial intelligence sorting system to separate it.</p><p>Throwing the new recyclable plastic in with your regular recycling pickup would probably be a waste of the plasticâ€™s unique properties, Hamers agrees. â€œThis isnâ€™t necessarily a barrier to commercialization. Existing biodegradable and compostable plastics face a similar challenge. Such plastics break down only under the right microbial conditions, but can end up in a landfill without those environments,â€ she says. A challenge will be to figure out how to divert these special recyclables into their own production streams, perhaps by using bar codes, as Mark S. proposes, or through a direct-to-manufacturer return process, she says.</p><h4>Bye-bye, birdie</h4><p><em>After human activities shrunk dusky seaside sparrowsâ€™ breeding grounds in 1968, the last of the species died in captivity nearly 20 years later at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Fla., Bethany Brookshire reported in â€œ<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-scientists-warned-sparrows-extinction?mode=magazine&amp;context=197053">50 years ago, scientists warned of a sparrowâ€™s extinction</a>â€ (</em>SN: 5/26/18, p. 4<em>).</em></p><p>â€œInquiring minds want to know why the worldâ€™s last dusky sparrow suffered the indignity of dying at Disney World, amid thousands of parents who were wishing they were dead,â€ online reader Jan Steinman wrote.</p><p>The bird lived in captivity on Discovery Island, a now-defunct zoological park.

The vast frozen sheets that had covered much of North America, Europe and Asia for thousands of years were retreating. Giant mammals â€” steppe bison, woolly mammoths and saber-toothed cats â€” grazed or hunted across tundra and grasslands. A Paleo-Indian group of hunter-gatherers who eventually gave rise to the Clovis people had crossed a land bridge from Asia hundreds of years earlier and were now spread across North America, hunting mammoth with distinctive spears.</p><p>Then, at about 12,800 years ago, something strange happened. Earth was abruptly plunged back into a deep chill. Temperatures in parts of the Northern Hemisphere plunged to as much as 8 degrees Celsius colder than today. The cold snap lasted only about 1,200 years â€” a mere blip, in geologic time. Then, just as abruptly, Earth began to warm again. But many of the giant mammals were dying out. And the Clovis people had apparently vanished.</p><p>Geologists call this blip of frigid conditions the Younger Dryas, and its cause is a mystery. Most researchers suspect that a large pulse of freshwater from a melting ice sheet and glacial lakes flooded into the ocean, briefly interfering with Earthâ€™s heat-transporting ocean currents. However, geologists have not yet found firm evidence of how and where this happened, such as traces of the path that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-pathway-proposed-ancient-flood?mode=magazine&amp;context=197053">this ancient flood traveled to reach the sea</a> (<em>SN: 12/29/12, p. 11</em>).</p><p></p><div class="lz-cont">   <img src="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/06/070718_CG_dryas_inline_1_globe.png?mode=magazine&amp;context=197053" data-echo="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/06/070718_CG_dryas_inline_1_globe.png?mode=magazine&amp;context=197053" alt="Laurentide Ice Sheet" class="caption" style="float: right; width: 370px; height: 373px;" title="About 20,000 years ago, the Laurentide Ice Sheet covered much of North America.

About 12,800 years ago, these researchers say, a comet â€” or perhaps its remnants â€” <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ice-age-ends-smashingly-did-comet-blow-over-eastern-canada?mode=magazine&amp;context=197053">hit or exploded over the Laurentide Ice Sheet</a> that once covered much of North America (<em>SN: 6/2/07, p. 339</em>).<p>Pieces of the comet most likely exploded in Earthâ€™s atmosphere, the researchers suggest, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0706977104">triggering wildfires across North America</a>.

Most scientists think that a similar aboveground explosion, known as an airburst, happened on a far smaller scale in 1908 over Siberiaâ€™s Tunguska region. That event produced as much energy as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/comet-likely-culprit-tunguska-blast?mode=magazine&amp;context=197053">1,000 Hiroshima bombs</a> (<em>SN Online: 7/28/09</em>). A similar but even larger cataclysm at the onset of the Younger Dryas, according to the hypothesisâ€™s proponents, would neatly solve several prehistoric puzzles, including what caused the extinctions of large animals and what happened to the Clovis people.</p><p>For more than a decade, scientific journals have been the battleground for skirmishes over this impact hypothesis. The idea has drawn opponents from a spectrum of scientific fields, including paleoclimatology, physics and archaeology. The critics contend that there is little to no reproducible or incontrovertible evidence for many of the key arguments of the hypothesis.</p><p>â€œOver and over and over, there are these things that are claimed to be proxies for an impact,â€ says Vance Holliday, an archaeologist and geologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. â€œAnd theyâ€™re all debatable, every single one.â€</p><p></p><div class="lz-cont">   <img src="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/06/070718_CG_dryas_inline_2_sticks_rev.jpg?mode=magazine&amp;context=197053" data-echo="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/06/070718_CG_dryas_inline_2_sticks_rev.jpg?mode=magazine&amp;context=197053" alt="" class="caption" style="width: 730px; height: 452px;" title="A 1908 airburst, probably from a comet exploding in Earthâ€™s atmosphere over Siberiaâ€™s Stony Tunguska River, flattened millions of trees.Â ~~Â Earthsound/Wikimedia Commons" /><noscript><img src="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/06/070718_CG_dryas_inline_2_sticks_rev.jpg?mode=magazine&amp;context=197053" alt="" class="caption" style="width: 730px; height: 452px;" title="A 1908 airburst, probably from a comet exploding in Earthâ€™s atmosphere over Siberiaâ€™s Stony Tunguska River, flattened millions of trees.Â ~~Â Earthsound/Wikimedia Commons" /></noscript> </div> <p>Allen West, a retired geophysicist who owned GeoScience Consulting in Dewey, Ariz., has long been a lead proponent of the impact hypothesis. West acknowledges that the hypothesis has been battered on all sides. â€œWe have different battles with different disciplines,â€ he says. He compares these battles to the fights that raged in the 1980s over whether an asteroid struck Earth 66 million years ago, killing off all dinosaurs except birds â€” an idea that he notes is now widely accepted.</p><p>â€œThere were just vicious, nasty attacks for nearly a decade on that,â€ West says. â€œPeople said it just couldnâ€™t have happened, and then they found the crater. Thatâ€™s probably what it would take with us, too.â€</p><p>Indeed, no craters have been found dating to the Younger Dryas, and the landscape of North America â€” the likely ground zero for such an impact, proponents say â€” has been pretty thoroughly checked out. In the absence of direct evidence of an impact, West and colleagues have turned to indirect evidence, releasing a steady stream of papers outlining numerous possible signs of an impact, all dating to about 12,800 years ago.</p><p>The latest salvo came in March, when West and more than two dozen researchers published a pair of papers in the<em> Journal of Geology</em>. The papers include <a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/695703">data from ice cores</a> as well as <a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/695704">sediment cores from land and sea</a>. The cores contain signatures of giant wildfires that support the idea of a widespread burning event about 12,800 years ago, West says.</p><p>The papers promptly elicited exasperation from some opponents, including Holliday. â€œWe have 10 years of this we have to deal with. They keep building on their past record, ignoring the critiques,â€ he says. â€œIt just drives me crazy.â€</p><h4><strong>Birth of a hypothesis</strong></h4><p>The first formal description of the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis came in 2007, when four researchers sat in front of a gaggle of reporters at the American Geophysical Unionâ€™s spring meeting in Acapulco, Mexico. The researchers, including West, had taken a close look at about two dozen sites across North America showing a â€œboundary layerâ€ of sediments dating to the onset of the Younger Dryas. Half a dozen of the sites also have thin layers of organic-rich sediments called â€œblack matsâ€ immediately overlying the boundary layer. Several of those sites show signs of occupation by the Clovis people.</p><div class="inline-content inline-content-right clearfix"><h4>A line in the clay</h4><div class="inline-content-copy"><p></p><div class="lz-cont">   <img src="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/06/070718_CG_dryas_inline_3_cave.jpg?mode=magazine&amp;context=197053" data-echo="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/06/070718_CG_dryas_inline_3_cave.jpg?mode=magazine&amp;context=197053" alt="" class="caption" style="width: 370px; height: 248px;" title="~~ Cave:Â R.B.

Some researchers say the layer holds markers of an extraterrestrial impact.</div></div><p>The mats apparently mark the line between occupation and absence at the Clovis sites: For example, a black mat at a site called Murray Springs, in Arizona, sits above a trove of Clovis artifacts, a fire pit and an almost fully articulated skeleton of an adult mammoth. But above the mat, there are no such artifacts; at Murray Springs and elsewhere, the fluted stone spearpoints made by the Clovis culture disappear from the archaeological record, leading to speculation that the people mysteriously and abruptly vanished.</p><p>Those Younger Dryas boundary layers, West and colleagues reported in 2007, contain a variety of intriguing items, including tiny round magnetized grains called microspherules, other magnetized grains of sediment, little spherules of carbon, hollow round carbon molecules called fullerenes and nanodiamonds. Chemical analyses also revealed spikes in iridium and nickel concentrations and in charcoal and soot.</p><p>Taken alone, these items may or may not be signs of an extraterrestrial impact: Microspherules, for instance, form when a material heats up and then rapidly cools. They can form during a volcanic eruption, from industrial pollution or as a result of an extraterrestrial impact.</p><p>But when taken together, such a suite of markers could point only to an extraterrestrial impact, the researchers concluded: Something struck Earth and exploded in its atmosphere at the onset of the Younger Dryas, about 12,800 years ago. The soot and charcoal suggested that the impact triggered widespread burning that blocked out the sun and brought about a thousand years of near-glacial temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere.</p><p>Because no impact crater dating to this time has been found, the researchers suggested that the impactor was probably already fragmented when it entered Earthâ€™s atmosphere. Smaller fragments would have done plenty of damage as they exploded in the atmosphere over the retreating Laurentide Ice Sheet, but they wouldnâ€™t have left much of a smoking hole in the ground.</p><p>The news made a splash â€” and scientists were intrigued (<em>SN: 6/2/07, p. 339</em>). The prospect of layers rich in impact markers found scattered across a continent was definitely worth investigating further. Mark Boslough, a physicist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, says that initially, he took the data at face value. â€œI thought, â€˜theyâ€™re on to something interesting.â€™ â€</p><h4><strong>Frustrations mount</strong></h4><p>Then scientists, Boslough included, began to do their own independent analyses. And questions arose. Some researchers claimed that they <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/10/09/0907857106">couldnâ€™t find strong evidence of some of the purported impact markers</a>, such as the microspherules and nanodiamonds. Others questioned the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jqs.2724">precision of the dating at many of the Younger Dryas boundary layer sites</a>, which would undermine the idea that one event affected them all simultaneously.</p><p></p><div class="lz-cont">   <img src="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/06/070718_CG_dryas_inline_5.jpg?mode=magazine&amp;context=197053" data-echo="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/06/070718_CG_dryas_inline_5.jpg?mode=magazine&amp;context=197053" alt="microspherules" class="caption" style="float: right; width: 370px; height: 321px;" title="Researchers wrangle over the meaning of impact markers (microspherules shown) in black mats. ~~Â R.B.

But none of the scenarios make sense, Boslough says. Either the pieces of a fragmented comet would have been too small to generate much energy or <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/109/34/E2241">they would have been too large not to leave craters</a>, he wrote in 2012.<p>Holliday, meanwhile, says that when it comes to the apparent disappearance of the Clovis culture, the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis is a solution to an archaeological problem that doesnâ€™t exist. Hunter-gatherers like the Paleo-Indian people who made Clovis points didnâ€™t stay at one site for long; itâ€™s no surprise that they would have moved on, Holliday says.</p><p>More important, he adds, â€œthere is no mysterious â€˜gapâ€™ in the archaeological record following the time that Clovis artifacts were made.â€ Immediately following the Clovis period, a different style of projectile points, called Folsom points, appeared. Paleo-Indian peoples probably just changed their spear technology due to a shift from hunting mammoth and mastodon to bison, Holliday says.</p><p>As for those large Ice Age animals such as mammoths, he adds, they were in decline, but their disappearance wasnâ€™t that sudden. â€œAll these animals running around and then, boom, at 12,800 years ago they just go away? Thatâ€™s just not the case,â€ Holliday says. â€œThese extinctions were global and happened at different times around the world.â€</p><p>The March papers focus mainly on the wildfires, a long-standing aspect of the original hypothesis. Greenland ice cores show peaks in ammonium dating to the onset of the Younger Dryas, which the researchers say, suggests large-scale biomass burning. These data were previously presented in 2010 by astrophysicist Adrian Melott of the University of Kansas in Lawrence and colleagues. They suggested that the ammonium ions in those ice cores could be best explained by an extraterrestrial impact. A similar spike dating to 1908 â€” the year of the airburst over Siberia â€” had also been found in those same cores. The papers also describe finding peaks in charcoal that date to the start of the cold snap.</p><p>â€œThe big thing here is a careful comparison of [many possible impact markers], normalized to the same dating method,â€ says Melott, one of the authors on the new impact papers. Those markers, including previously described evidence of microspherules, iridium and platinum dust, are consistent with having been caused by the same event, he says.</p><p>However, Jennifer Marlon, a paleoecologist and paleoclimatologist at Yale University and an expert on biomass burning, has taken her own look at sediments in North America dated to between 15,000 and 10,000 years ago. She sees no evidence for continent-wide fires dating specifically to the onset of the Younger Dryas.</p><p>â€œIâ€™ve studied charcoal records for many years now,â€ Marlon says. In 2009, she and colleagues <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/106/8/2519">reported data on charcoal and pollen</a> in lake sediments across North America. Importantly, the sediment records in her study encompassed not only the years of the Younger Dryas cold episode, but also a few thousand years before and after.</p><p>Her team found multiple small peaks of wildfires, but none of them were near the beginning of the Younger Dryas. â€œForests burn in North America all the time,â€ she says. â€œYou canâ€™t find a cubic centimeter of sediment in any lake on this continent that doesnâ€™t have charcoal in it.â€</p><div class="inline-content inline-content-left clearfix" style="width:100%; float:none;"><h4>Missing peak</h4><div class="inline-content-copy"><p>Charcoal records from 15 lake sediment cores from across North America show how often fires occurred at each site over 5,000 years.

Marlon<em> et al</em>/<em>PNAS</em> 2009</div></div></div><p>Such fires could be triggered by rapid climate change, when ecosystems are quickly reorganizing and more dead fuel might be available. â€œThat can cause major vegetation changes and fires,â€ Marlon says. â€œWe donâ€™t need to invoke a comet.â€</p><p>The problem with the data in the recent papers, Marlon says, is that the researchers look only at a narrow time period, making it difficult to evaluate how large or unusual the signals really were. From her data, there appeared to have been more burning toward the <em>end</em> of the Younger Dryas, when the planet began to warm abruptly again.</p><p>â€œThat speaks to my fundamental problem with the biomass burning part of the papers,â€ Marlon says. â€œI donâ€™t understand why theyâ€™re zooming in. Itâ€™s what makes me skeptical.â€</p><p>Holliday echoes that criticism. â€œMost of the time they sample only around this time interval,â€ he says. What would be more convincing, he says, are data from cores that span 15,000 to 20,000 years, sampled every five centimeters or so. â€œIf this is a unique event, then we shouldnâ€™t see anything like it in the last 15,000 years.â€</p><p>West says that other peaks are irrelevant, because the impact hypothesis doesnâ€™t imply that there was only one wildfire, just that one occurred around 12,800 years ago. He adds that the new papers suggest that Marlon and her colleagues didnâ€™t correctly calibrate the radiocarbon dates for their samples. When done correctly, he says, one spike in fires that Marlon estimated at around 13,200 years ago actually occurred several hundred years later â€” right around 12,800 years ago.</p><p>Radiocarbon dating for such old events is challenging regardless of calibration, Marlon says. Thatâ€™s why she analyzed and compared her sites in several different ways, yet still found no unusual peak at 12,800 years. In fact, she says, many of the sites show no signs of burning at that time.</p><p>As for whether the impact hypothesis proponents have ignored scientific criticisms, West rejects this. â€œWe have directly rebutted those criticisms multiple times,â€ he says. An upcoming paper he and others are preparing will describe in detail those rebuttals, such as errors he says previous critics made in properly reproducing the analyses West and his colleagues used to identify a key impact marker, the magnetic spherules.</p><p>Yet critics of the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis say that too many questions remain unanswered. Holliday says he and others are preparing a response to the <em>Journal of Geology</em> papers, outlining numerous points of contention.</p><p>â€œConfronting and dealing with critical reviews and contradictory data is a significant problem in this debate,â€ Holliday says. None of the rebuttals have dealt with various criticisms, he adds, such as the proper dating of rock layers and soils, and the contradictory data over animal extinctions and Paleo-Indian archaeology.</p><p>â€œWe all love a good debate,â€ Marlon says, â€œbut I know thereâ€™s a lot of frustration in the communityâ€ that this hypothesis persists. Like many opponents of the impact hypothesis, she says that the data presented in the new papers have done nothing to change her mind about the comet strike. â€œIt didnâ€™t happen.â€</p><p>All the same, Marlon understands the allure. â€œI have had pet theories, too. We are pattern-seekers. We tend to see things that look like a signal and so many times theyâ€™re not. A comet is simpler and more visually compelling â€” more appealing, in a way â€” than trying to sort out what Earthbound trigger might have caused such an abrupt climate change.</p><p>â€œI wish the evidence were stronger for [an impact],â€ she says. â€œItâ€™s not as much fun when it turns out to be a more complicated, nuanced story.â€</p><hr /><p><em>This article appears in the July 7, 2018 issue ofÂ </em>Science News<em>Â with the headline, "The impact hypothesis that won\'t die: Critics are still unconvinced that a comet caused a mysterious cold snap 12,800 years ago."</em></p></span></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="field field-name-field-article-citation field-type-text-long field-label-above">       <div class="field-label">Citations</div>     <div class="field-items">           <div class="field-item even"><p>Wendy S.

schema:articleBody"><span itemprop="description"><p>Burrowing giant clams have perfected the ship-in-a-bottle trick, and the one big thing that scientists convinced themselves couldnâ€™t explain it, actually can.</p><p><em>Tridacna crocea</em>, the smallest of the 10 or so giant clam species, grows a shell that eventually reaches the size of a large fist. Starting as youngsters, the burrowers bore into the stony mass of an Indo-Pacific coral reef, trapping themselves behind a too-skinny exit for their entire decades-long lives.</p><p>Only the extravagantly colored upper edges of the clamâ€™s body can push out the thin slit in the reef. These protruding frills teem with algae related to those in corals. Basking in sunlight, the algae pay rent in the form of a substantial portion of a giant clamâ€™s nourishment.</p><p>The clams â€œactually have eyes in this tissue,â€ says environmental physiologist Richard Hill of Michigan State University in East Lansing. At the slightest shadow â€” a predator, perhaps â€” the clam yanks in such vulnerable parts through the very narrow crack. â€œItâ€™s as if the clam vanished,â€ he says.</p><p>The colors the clam creates on this extendable tissue approach the psychedelic and can bewitch aquarium hobbyists into paying three-figure sums. â€œThe ones that get the big money are turquoise,â€ Hill says, but heâ€™s seen indigo blue as well as yellow, crimson and even a boring brown.</p><p>The opposite rim of the clam body, hidden deep inside the coral crevice, looks anything but colorful. Â Through a hole near the shell hinge, a soft cream-colored mass called (quite unfairly) the â€œboring organ,â€ emerges. Like pulling on a gym sock, this tissue spreads upward over the shell. A sock embrace puts the tissue in touch with the cave wall that the clam must erode as it grows.</p><p>A leading mollusk biologist of the 20th century, <a href="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/42820310#page/365/mode/1up">Sir Charles Maurice Yonge</a>, proposed that boring organs gradually dissolve the rock by secreting acid. Yet he shot down his own theory (and fretted about it through the rest of his life) by adding a color-changing pH indicator to the clamâ€™s seawater.

She took an unusual route to fame. Stanford University graduate student Francine Patterson started teaching Koko a version of sign language in 1972, the year after the infant ape was born. Patterson rapidly developed a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/documentary-looks-meaning-koko-gorilla%E2%80%99s-life?mode=topic&amp;context=49">deep emotional connection to Koko</a>.</p><p>Pattersonâ€™s claims that Koko learned to communicate and converse with sign language in a humanlike way won the gorilla legions of fans but also attracted much scientific criticism. Pattersonâ€™s work with Koko came at a time when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/behavior-357?mode=topic&amp;context=49">captive chimps were also receiving sign language training</a>.</p><p><em>Science News</em> spoke with anthropologist Barbara King about Kokoâ€™s legacy. King, of the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va., studies emotions and thinking in nonhuman animals. Her books include <em>How Animals Grieve</em>.</p><h3><strong>Q: What were your first thoughts upon hearing that Koko had died?</strong></h3><p><strong>A: </strong>My first response wasnâ€™t thoughts, but tears. After that, a reflection on how Koko taught us so much about the great ape mind, even while she paid a cost, in her own daily life, for our scientific curiosity.</p><h3><strong>Q: What is Kokoâ€™s scientific legacy, especially for understanding ape communication?</strong></h3><p><strong>A: </strong>How amazing Koko was, a creative and resourceful ape who could vibrantly show us that great apes think and feel, all because she understood how to use aspects of â€œourâ€ language. She could use signs of American Sign Language in meaningful ways to discuss not only her likes and dislikes but also her emotions. At one and the same time, she was an utterly special gorilla because of how she was raised and yet alsoÂ an exemplar of what all our closest living primate relatives do â€” reason, feel and negotiate daily life through a complex set of social interactions.</p><h3><strong>Q: Did Francine Patterson get too close to Koko to perform credible studies?</strong></h3><p><strong>A: </strong>Certainly there were cases of <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2015/12/10/459181304/famous-gorilla-s-climate-speech">over-interpretations</a> made throughout the years regarding Kokoâ€™s behavior and utterances that damaged the researchersâ€™ credibility. Parading Koko around to give a climate-change speech is just one example. What concerns me more are the <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2014/08/koko_kanzi_and_ape_language_research_criticism_of_working_conditions_and.html">ethics of confining her in a highly unnatural world</a>, one where she couldnâ€™t live in a social group with other gorillas and where she was treated in highly questionable ways regarding her diet and medical care.</p><h3><strong>Q: How do you explain Kokoâ€™s broad and lasting cultural appeal?</strong></h3><p><strong>A: </strong>Who among us hasnâ€™t wanted to know what gorillas think, and for that matter, elephants, dolphins, our dogs and cats, chickens and cows? Koko allowed us a glimpse into a marvelous mind. She reached us all one way or another, as when she touched childrenâ€™s hearts when a book went viral about her sadness at the death of her kitten.</p><h3><strong>Q: Should scientists pursue new sign language studies in apes like those conducted with Koko?</strong></h3><p><strong>A: </strong>Full stop, no. Over the 46 years of Kokoâ€™s life, we have learned enough to recognize that it is imperative to focus on getting funding to move chimpanzees and monkeys confined to biomedical laboratories to retirement in sanctuaries. The last thing we need is to confine a great ape and train him or her to adopt aspects of our language.</p></span></div></div></div><span property="rnews:name schema:name" content="Koko the gorilla is gone, but she left a legacy" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>        '),

The painted lady butterfly (<em>Vanessa cardui</em>) now boasts the farthest known butterfly migration.</p><p>Though found across the world, the orange-and-brown beauties that live in Southern Europe migrate into Africa each fall, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/painted-lady-butterflies%E2%80%99-migration-may-take-them-across-sahara?mode=topic&amp;context=76">crossing the Sahara on their journey</a> (<em>SN Online: 10/12/16</em>). But what happened after was a mystery because the butterflies disappeared. Researchers hypothesized that the insects either remained in Africa or made a round-trip, but there was no evidence either way.</p><p>A new chemical analysis of butterfly wings suggests that the butterflies head back to Europe in the spring. The round-trip, which usually plays out over several generations, is an annual journey of 12,000 kilometers, about 2,000 more than <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/flying-insects-tell-tales-long-distance-migrations?mode=topic&amp;context=76">successive generations of monarchs are known to travel in a year</a> (<em>SN: 4/14/18, p. 22</em>).</p><p>Researchers were surprised when they detected chemical markers from Africa on some European butterfliesâ€™ wings.

The study, reported in the June 13 <em>Biology Letters</em>, <a href="http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/14/6/20180274">provides evidence that the creatures return from Africa each year</a>.

Those invaders, Asian common toads, have been slowly spreading across the large island ever since.</p><p>The toadâ€™s skin contains a toxin that kills nearly anything that tries to eat the amphibian. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/invasive-toads-will-probably-overrun-madagascar?mode=blog&amp;context=116">Scientists have been warning</a> of the toadâ€™s danger to ecosystems for years, but theyâ€™ve lacked evidence of just how dangerous the toads could be. Now, a genetic study confirms that nearly all of Madagascarâ€™s predators would be vulnerable to the toadâ€™s toxin.</p><p><em>Duttaphrynus melanostictus</em> is one of many toad species that secrete potent toxins called bufadienolides. These chemicals disrupt the flow of sodium and potassium in cell walls, something that is particularly important for the function of muscles, and especially the heart.</p><p>â€œAnimals that are not resistant to the toads that take a mouthful of toad can die extremely quickly from heart failure,â€ says Wolfgang WÃ¼ster, a herpetologist at Bangor University in Wales.</p><p></p><div class="lz-cont">   <img src="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/06/061818_SZ_toads-wild-things_inline_370.jpg?mode=blog&amp;context=116" data-echo="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/06/061818_SZ_toads-wild-things_inline_370.jpg?mode=blog&amp;context=116" alt="Asian common toad in Madagascar village" class="caption" style="float: right; width: 370px; height: 323px;" title="The Asian common toad is now spreading across Madagascar, posing a threat to the islandâ€™s unique wildlife. ~~ Franco Andreone" /><noscript><img src="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/06/061818_SZ_toads-wild-things_inline_370.jpg?mode=blog&amp;context=116" alt="Asian common toad in Madagascar village" class="caption" style="float: right; width: 370px; height: 323px;" title="The Asian common toad is now spreading across Madagascar, posing a threat to the islandâ€™s unique wildlife. ~~ Franco Andreone" /></noscript> </div> There are species, including reptiles and mammals, that have evolved resistance to the toxin. And in 2015, WÃ¼ster and other scientists reported that these examples of resistance <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/112/38/11911">shared a commonality</a>: They all had specific mutations in the gene for the sodium-potassium pump. â€œThatâ€™s a universal mechanism for being able to consume toads â€” and particularly to deal with the bufo toxins,â€ says WÃ¼ster.<p>Toxic toads are an invasive species in several places around the world. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/quick-moving-toads-take-straight-and-narrow-path?mode=blog&amp;context=116">Cane toads</a>, for instance, have been spreading across northern Australia for decades, leading to declines of species such as quolls and snakes. That invasion is well-studied, and so scientists know a lot about the species affected by it. Thereâ€™s little need there to start looking for species that are immune to the toxin. But in areas of more-recent invasions, such as Indonesia and Madagascar, such data could be helpful.</p><p>So WÃ¼ster and his colleagues looked at the gene for the sodium-potassium pump in 77 Malagasy species, including 28 birds, eight mammals and 27 snakes. Only one species, the <a href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/2991/0">white-tailed antsangy</a>, a type of rodent, had the mutations that would make it immune to the toad toxin. The mutations were the same as those found in the brown rat, which suggests that they might be a common feature among rodents. <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)30452-4">The 76 other species studied are likely vulnerable to the toad toxin</a>, the researchers conclude June 4 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p><p>This doesnâ€™t mean, however, that Madagascarâ€™s wildlife is entirely doomed. In Australia, scientists have documented behavioral changes in some predator species that have allowed them to safely eat toads. Some birds, for instance, have learned that toad tongues are safe to eat. Some Malagasy species could likewise figure out how to safely make a meal of the toads â€” or learn to not eat them at all.</p><p>People might help as well. Itâ€™s probably too late to eradicate the toads from Madagascar. Thereâ€™s too many, and thereâ€™s no good way to easily find and kill them. But this research may help scientists in Madagascar to take measures to protect certain species or sites from the invasive species, WÃ¼ster says. Â </p><p>â€œMadagascar has been isolated for tens of millions of years,â€ notes WÃ¼ster. â€œItâ€™s never had toads. Why would the local animals be resistant to toads? We always expected them to be sensitive. But now we have much better evidence that thatâ€™s really the case.â€</p></span></div></div></div><span property="rnews:name schema:name" content="Madagascarâ€™s predators are probably vulnerable to toxic toads" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>                    '),

But just what the demise means for the iconic species is up for debate.</p><p>Â â€œWhilst we are saddened about the death and collapse [of the old trees], current evidence does not indicate that this is affecting the whole population,â€ says plant scientist Sarah Venter, who was not part of the new study. Venter, with the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, does not see an immediate threat to the species as a whole. These trees of extreme age â€œwere probably more vulnerable to dry conditions,â€ she says. â€œTree mortality is complex and can be attributed to many causes, including climate change and droughts.â€</p><p>The <em>Adansonia digitata </em>species of the baobab group is the longest-living kind of flowering tree. With its mass of skinny branches dividing like rootlets over a fat trunk, the species sometimes gets teased as an upside-down tree. Long-stemmed brown fruits also encourage the nickname â€œdead-rat tree.â€ Yet people have long cherished the giant baobabs for food, medicine and spiritual value.</p><p>Of the 13 oldest known <em>A. digitata</em>, four have died since 2005, says study coauthor Adrian Patrut, who specializes in inorganic and nuclear chemistry at BabeÅŸ-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca, Romania.

Patrut, Roxana Patrut" /></noscript> </div> <p>The oldest to die, the Panke tree in Zimbabwe, had lived about 2,500 years before it collapsed over the course of 2010 and 2011. The other three trees that died, including the Chapman tree in Botswana, were just 1,250 to 1,500 years old. Â </p><p>Patrut does not think mere old age caused their demise. He worries something more troubling may be going on instead. â€œThere were no signs of an epidemic,â€ Patrut says. He suspects that a warming trend observed in southern Africa may be playing a role.</p><p>As world-famous as baobabs are, much of their drought biology and other basic matters remain mysterious. â€œDoes anyone really know the rooting structure of baobabs?â€ laments plant ecologist Eugene Moll of the University of the Western Cape in Bellville, South Africa. For understanding Africaâ€™s plants, â€œphilosophies and paradigms that originate north of 40Â° N do not necessarily apply down here in the Southern Hemisphere,â€ he says. â€œWe humans like symmetry but nature is certainly not always symmetrical.â€</p></span></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="field field-name-field-article-citation field-type-text-long field-label-above">       <div class="field-label">Citations</div>     <div class="field-items">           <div class="field-item even"><p>A.

But the rain can hit hard, especially for a small ant. When leaf-cutting ants sense an incoming shower, they <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00040-018-0605-z">hoof it back to their nests</a>, says a study in the May <i>Insectes Sociaux</i>.</p><p>Researchers from Argentina, Mexico and Peru tested how one species of leaf-cutting ants, <i>Atta cephalotes</i>, in Costa Rica deals with rain. The scientists placed hollow boxes filled with wet cotton on ant trails in the forest. When<i> A. cephalotes </i>walked through the boxes, they experienced higher relative humidity, as if it were about to rain. In another experiment, the researchers poured water on plants beside the trail to simulate falling raindrops. Both situations caused the ants to scramble to their nest up to 30 percent faster than normal, from about 1.21 meters per minute to 1.49.</p><p>The researchers think that leaf-cutter ants speed up to keep their cargo and themselves dry, with good reason: A wet leaf fragment weighs more than double a dry one. In the study, when the ants or leaves got wet, the insects readily dropped their harvest and returned to the nest. But by hurrying along at the first hints of rain, the ants could stay dry and hold onto the leaves.</p></span></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="field field-name-field-article-citation field-type-text-long field-label-above">       <div class="field-label">Citations</div>     <div class="field-items">           <div class="field-item even"><p>A.G.

Four newly described frog fossils, preserved in amber, offer the earliest direct evidence of ancient frogs living in a humid tropical clime â€” just as many modern amphibians do.</p><p>None of the frog fossils is complete, making it difficult to place the frogs within their family tree: One has a partial skull and another a froggy outline, although CT scanning revealed no remaining skeletal material inside the impression. So <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26848-w">researchers dubbed all four fossils <em>Electrorana limoae</em></a> (<em>electrum</em> for â€œamberâ€ and <em>rana</em> for â€œfrogâ€) in a study published June 14 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>. Anatomy-wise, the ancient frogs most resemble a modern group that includes fire-bellied toads.</p><p>The fossil record contains relatively few frogs, despite the amphibiansâ€™ more than 200-million-year history. The frog fossils that do exist suggest that frogs have looked distinctly â€” well, froggy â€” for hundreds of millions of years, says study coauthor David Blackburn, an amphibian biologist at the Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville. â€œThe aspects that make them diverse are not their skeletons, itâ€™s their ecologies, natural histories, reproductive modes. Things that are really hard to find in the fossil record.â€</p><p>Thatâ€™s what makes the amber specimens so interesting: The chunks also contain preserved spiders, velvet worms and bamboo â€” all pointing to a tropical environment. Such paleoecological evidence offers scientists a rare glimpse into the life and times of tropical frogs of old.</p></span></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="field field-name-field-article-citation field-type-text-long field-label-above">       <div class="field-label">Citations</div>     <div class="field-items">           <div class="field-item even"><p>L.

But for the first time, researchers have been able to eavesdrop on the creatures for days at a time as these unicorns of the sea dove, fed and socialized.</p><p>Biologist Susanna Blackwell and colleagues listened in on the clicks, buzzes and calls of the East Greenland narwhal (<em>Monodon monoceros</em>). The teamâ€™s findings, published June 13 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>, <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198295">provide a peek into the daily behavior</a> of the long-toothed whale. The research could help scientists determine how human-made noises may affect narwhals as the Arctic warms due to climate change and shipping lanes become more open.</p><p>Many whale sounds are recorded using hydrophones, underwater microphones that dangle in the water. But these acoustic devices have several drawbacks: They canâ€™t sense the depth or direction from which noise comes, and they canâ€™t detect which animal is making a sound.</p><p>Blackwell and colleagues skirted these issues by attaching an acoustic recording device to the narwhals themselves. â€œIt is really like sitting on the back of a narwhal for a few days and experiencing the world,â€ Blackwell says.</p><div class="inline-content inline-content-right clearfix"><h4>Narwhal noise</h4><div class="inline-content-copy"><p>Listen to two recordings of East Greenland narwhals collected by researchers from 2013 to 2016.</p><h3>Feeling chatty</h3><p>Several whales socialize with each other at a depth of 65 meters, using clicks, whistles and trumpet sounds.</p><iframe allow="autoplay" frameborder="no" height="100" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/457805985%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-YCSRb&amp;color=%23106185&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true" width="100%"></iframe><div style="color: rgb(170, 170, 170); text-transform: uppercase; line-height: 12px; font-size: 10px; height: auto; text-align: right;">Audio: S.

The devices were attached with suction cups, and held in place for several days by a nylon string threaded through a ridge of cartilage on the narwhalsâ€™ backs. After three to eight days in the water, magnesium links to the string degraded and released the device, which the researchers retrieved using GPS.</p><p>Tagging <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/narwhals-react-certain-dangers-really-strange-way?mode=magazine&amp;context=197053">was stressful for the narwhals</a>, says Blackwell, who works for Greeneridge Sciences, Inc., the Santa Barbara, Calif., company that manufactures the acoustic devices (<em>SN Online: 12/7/17</em>). But after a day of silence, the narwhals resumed their normal behavior.</p><p>Like other species of toothed whales, narwhals use echolocation to hunt in the dark arctic waters. â€œTheyâ€™re like wet bats,â€ says Kate Stafford, an oceanographer at the University of Washington in Seattle who did not participate in the study. The researchers found that the narwhals clicked while diving to locate their prey, often arctic and polar cod or squid. When closing in on a meal, the clicking sounds turned into a rapid buzzing noise. At the surface, the narwhals used whistle and trumpetlike calls to communicate with one another.</p><p>â€œWe were very surprised that they actually have a very specialized way of using sound,â€ says study coauthor Mads Peter Heide-JÃ¸rgensen, a biologist at the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources based in Copenhagen. The narwhalsâ€™ sounds varied not only with each activity the animals did, but also with their depth.</p><div class="inline-content inline-content-left clearfix" style="width:100%; float:none;"><h4>Narwhal diary</h4><div class="inline-content-copy"><p>Eistla, a female narwhal with a young calf, was one of six narwhals that researchers listened in on. She remained fairly silent immediately after having an acoustic device attached to her and being released. But by the second day, she became more vocal, clicking (blue lines) as she dove and buzzing (black circles) as she closed in on prey. Yellow squares mark calls made by Eistla or other nearby narwhals. The device detached on the fifth day.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;">Types of sounds used by a narwhal vary with depth and time of day</h3><p></p><div class="lz-cont">   <img src="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/06/061318_LR_narwhal_inline_730.png?mode=magazine&amp;context=197053" data-echo="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/06/061318_LR_narwhal_inline_730.png?mode=magazine&amp;context=197053" alt="" class="caption" style="width: 730px; height: 378px;" title="~~ S.

Human presence in the Arctic is increasing thanks to climate change, says Jens Koblitz, a bioacoustician at the University of Konstanz in Germany.

Honeybees are the first invertebrates to pass a test of recognizing where zero goes in numerical order, a new study finds.</p><p>Even small children struggle with recognizing â€œnothingâ€ as being less than one, says cognitive behavioral scientist Scarlett Howard of the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Australia. But honeybees trained to fly to images of greater or fewer dots or whazzits <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aar4975">tended to rank a blank image as less than one</a>, Howard and colleagues report in the June 8 <em>Science</em>.</p><p>Despite decades of discoveries, nonhuman animals still donâ€™t get due credit outside specialist circles for intelligence, laments Lars Chittka of Queen Mary University of London, who has explored various mental capacities of bees. For the world at large, he emphasizes that the abilities described in the new paper are â€œremarkable.â€</p><p>Researchers recognize several levels of complexity in grasping zero. Most animals, or maybe all, can understand the simplest level â€” just recognizing that the absence of something differs from its presence, Howard says. Grasping the notion that absence could fit into a sequence of quantities, though, seems harder. Previously, only some primates such as chimps and vervet monkeys, plus an African gray parrot named Alex, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animals-give-clues-origins-human-number-crunching?mode=magazine&amp;context=197053">have demonstrated this level of understanding of the concept of zero</a> (<em>SN: 12/10/16, p. 22</em>).</p><p>The researchers first trained bees to visit a spot with either a Y-shaped maze or an upright display, both offering images with different numbers of elements, such as dark circles of different sizes. Some bees were trained to fly to the image with the lower numbers of objects, while other bees were taught to go to the higher-number image. The researchers offered the bees a sweet treat for the correct image, and a bitter quinine solution for a wrong answer.</p><p>â€œI was fairly afraid of bees when I began working with them,â€ Howard says. But learning their ways convinced her that a lot of what humans mistake for aggression from a foraging bee buzzing around is usually â€œjust curiosity.â€</p><p>The trained bees then performed a series of tests with no rewards. In one test that offered the bees a choice between a single shape image versus a blank image, bees trained to pick the lower number of objects flew to the blank image â€” the zero â€” 63 percent of time. Overall, the test results showed the bees treating zero as being less than one, Howard says.</p><p>The results convince evolutionary behavioral biologist Rafael RodrÃ­guez of the University of Wisconsinâ€“Milwaukee that honeybees are indeed getting the basics of zero. Now heâ€™s wondering about earlier studies that might hint that certain spiders would be worth testing, too.</p><p>Still, the most sophisticated sense of zero, using a symbol for it in mathematical calculation, is a feat only humans have demonstrated. So far. Howard muses about the possibility of someday testing beesâ€™ prowess on that harder feat.</p></span></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="field field-name-field-article-citation field-type-text-long field-label-above">       <div class="field-label">Citations</div>     <div class="field-items">           <div class="field-item even"><p>S.R.

A new study describes how efforts to protect the endangered northern quoll, a spotted, kitten-sized marsupial native to Australia, by placing a population on a threat-free island may have actually undermined a key survival instinct.</p><p>After 13 generations â€” just 13 years â€” in isolation, the northern quolls (<em>Dasyurus hallucatus</em>) had <a href="http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/14/6/20180222">lost their fear response</a> to native predators, researchers report June 5 in <em>Biology Letters</em>.</p><p>â€œEvolution can happen very rapidlyâ€ for animals with fast breeding times, says evolutionary biologist Rick Shine of the University of Sydney, who was not involved in the study.Â </p><p>Separating endangered species from predators is a common conservation technique, sometimes taking place in captive-breeding programs in zoos or fenced enclosures or on isolated islands. The approach allows a species to build up its population before eventually being reintroduced to the wild.</p><p>Populations of northern quolls have been drastically reduced in recent decades by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/cane-toads-can-handle-cool?mode=magazine&amp;context=197053">invasive poisonous cane toads</a> (<em>SN Online: 2/3/14</em>). In 2003, the Australian Northern Territory Government tried to preserve the quolls in part by moving 45 of them to toad-free Astell Island, off mainland Australiaâ€™s northern coast.</p><p></p><div class="lz-cont">   <img src="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/06/main/articles/060618_lr_quoll_toad_inline_370.jpg?mode=magazine&amp;context=197053" data-echo="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/06/main/articles/060618_lr_quoll_toad_inline_370.jpg?mode=magazine&amp;context=197053" alt="a cane toad" class="caption" style="width: 370px; height: 247px; float: right;" title="&lt;b&gt;INVADER&lt;/b&gt;  Northern quolls were isolated to protect them from poisonous cane toads, an invasive species responsible for killing many native animals. ~~ Chris Jolly" /><noscript><img src="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/06/main/articles/060618_lr_quoll_toad_inline_370.jpg?mode=magazine&amp;context=197053" alt="a cane toad" class="caption" style="width: 370px; height: 247px; float: right;" title="&lt;b&gt;INVADER&lt;/b&gt;  Northern quolls were isolated to protect them from poisonous cane toads, an invasive species responsible for killing many native animals. ~~ Chris Jolly" /></noscript> </div> In 2016, biologist Christopher Jolly of the University of Melbourne and colleagues tried to reintroduce some quolls from Astell to the mainland. But the effort was quickly halted after <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/cats-and-foxes-are-driving-australia%E2%80%99s-mammals-extinct?mode=magazine&amp;context=197053">dingoes and feral cats killed</a> many of the new arrivals (<em>SN Online: 2/11/15</em>).<p>In trying to figure out what happened, the researchers tested the fear responses of four populations of quolls: wild mainland quolls, island-born quolls and offspring from both groups. Quolls from each group were given boxes of mealworms; some had no scent and some were tainted with the scent of either feral cats or dingoes. While the wild quolls shied away from the predator-scented worms, the island quolls slurped the worms down. The quoll babies in each group showed the same behavior as the adults, suggesting the lost fear response was not learned but had evolved over 13 generations.</p><p>The studyâ€™s findings may have implications for other animals as well, as Australia grapples with how to conserve an increasing number of threatened and endangered species. â€œFor many of Australiaâ€™s mammals, the future is fenced,â€ says Alexandra Carthey, an ecologist at Macquarie University in Sydney who was not involved in the study.</p><p>There may be a few other solutions. Quolls could possibly be <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/aec.12551">trained to avoid the cane toad</a>, and then wouldnâ€™t need to be taken from their native habitat, according to a study by Jolly and colleagues published last October in <em>Austral Ecology</em>. Or, a small number of predators could be added to the isolation locations â€” not enough to threaten the quollsâ€™ proliferation, but enough to put the fear back into them.</p></span></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="field field-name-field-article-citation field-type-text-long field-label-above">       <div class="field-label">Citations</div>     <div class="field-items">           <div class="field-item even"><p>C.

We are thrilled to share an edited summary of the conversation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I would love to start by discussing your experience as an International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) finalist in 1989. </strong></p><p>Before I share my experience, I do want to make one acknowledgement to Professor David Wilson of Vanderbilt, who unfortunately passed away last year. He was a local legend in Nashville. He was a chemistry professor who gave back to the community by offering local students the ability to apply their math aptitude in the lab.</p><p>I had just won an Algebra 1 math contest, and this older gentleman came up to me and said: &ldquo;Hey, would you like to apply your math? There&rsquo;s this competition called the International Science and Engineering Fair, and if you can commit to me for a few years, when you&rsquo;re a junior or senior, you can apply to that competition. If you stick with me and give me your best, you will do well there.&rdquo;</p><p>So that summer we went through trigonometry, calculus and differential equations. When you&rsquo;re a kid, you don&rsquo;t appreciate the time that adults put into you. But now in hindsight, I don&rsquo;t know where he found the time or the energy to give me all that effort.</p><p><img alt="" class="caption" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/images/gideonyu.jpg" style="width: 750px; height: 500px;" title="Gideon Yu with his science fair awards. ~~ Photo courtesy of Gideon Yu." /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mentors are so, so important in this work. You don&rsquo;t get anywhere without a mentor or teacher, especially when doing research. </strong></p><p>So, I just got finished winning the Tennessee state fair, which is a far cry from ISEF. Dr. Wilson sat me down and said, &ldquo;Look, the best projects from Tennessee have gotten third or second place, so you need to be happy with that.&rdquo;</p><p>I went to ISEF, which was in Pittsburgh that year, and was sitting in the Grand Awards Ceremony. Third place comes, no name. Second place comes, no name. Embarrassingly, I was very emotional that I didn&rsquo;t make it. I put my head down, and I had tears in my eyes. Some of the people at my table were consoling me.</p><p>There was a really awkward moment where the person sitting next to me said, &ldquo;Hey, didn&rsquo;t you say you were from Nashville?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I think they just called your name.&rdquo; I looked at him and said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a funny joke.&rdquo; Then several of the other people around the table said, &ldquo;They just called you. Go up there!&rdquo; I went up to the stage with my hand covering my mouth, which was wide open. Everybody else was smiling, and I just looked like I was completely shocked and didn&rsquo;t think I belonged up there. I won the Grand Award in the environmental sciences category.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You grew up the son of a minister in the South. You&rsquo;re Korean-American. Tell us about that, how those experiences and upbringing impacted your career path?</strong></p><p>In 1972, my parents decided to immigrate to Nashville from South Korea. I was 1 year old. In 2018, it&rsquo;s difficult to think back to what it was like in the Deep South at that time, but to put the region and time in context, the civil rights marches from Selma to Montgomery were in 1965, and they took place less than a day&rsquo;s drive from my home.</p><p>We immigrated with no money as an ethnic minority into the South when people were still facing discrimination regarding their civil rights. To have lived through that time, with my father as the pastor of my church and moral compass of our community &hellip; it was, how do I put it? It was tough. It was challenging, and it is something that I feel really shaped who I am today. More importantly, I would not have had it any other way.</p><p>I think when you grow up around racism, around racial and ethnic segregation, you realize that that the world is very aware of an individual&rsquo;s race. Adversity is a challenge, but it&rsquo;s also an opportunity and a fact of life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You&rsquo;ve had this incredible trajectory of working with the most well-known tech companies in the world. Yahoo, YouTube, Facebook. What was your guiding force along that path? Was it more about being at the right time at the right place or was there a larger plan?</strong></p><p>I wish that I could tell you that it was all planned out. And that I&rsquo;m smart enough to have figured that out, but that&rsquo;d be very imprecise.</p><p>Let me go backwards to answer this question a little bit. I got my undergraduate degree from Stanford and my MBA from Harvard. It was 1999 and I came out to Silicon Valley. I went to two start-ups as the CFO; both failed. I needed to figure out what my career path should be.</p><p>I realized that I didn&rsquo;t really feel passionate about either company and took those jobs because I thought they were good career moves. I decided that to the extent that I was lucky enough to have a choice, my future career moves would be consistent with things that I am passionate about.</p><p>Is it right place, right moment? Look, to the extent that that phrase indicates a humility and an understanding that you work really hard and then you get some good breaks, then absolutely, it was right place, right time. But I will tell you this: My overarching strategy was, if I&rsquo;m going to fail, I might as well fail doing something that I love.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>So, let&rsquo;s talk about football and how you ended up becoming president and co-owner of the San Francisco 49ers in 2012. </strong></p><p>The traditional career path to become a president in the NFL is certainly not science and finance. I&rsquo;ll tell you, Maya, that the comment I just made a little bit ago about following your passions is really what put me on the path to the NFL. I love football. I was on a charity board with the owners of the 49ers, and after a meeting commented that I had read they were having a difficult time raising the financing to build a new stadium. I offered to help, and a few months later they took me up on my offer. I made some suggestions, and they asked me to join them.</p><p>I took the plunge and was later named president of the team and was offered a chance to buy into the team. Although I&rsquo;m no longer president, I remain a co-owner of the team.</p><p>To become an owner in the NFL, or even a co-owner, you must be voted in by all the other NFL owners. When I was voted in, they noted that I was going to be the first ethnic minority president in the history of the NFL. After the vote, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones shook my hand and said, &ldquo;Welcome to the club. This is history.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the moment when all of the hard work is worth it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do you remember any books in high school that got you excited, and what are you reading now?</strong></p><p>In high school, the book that I read that just blew my mind was <em>A Brief History of Time</em> by Stephen Hawking. Outside of the Bible, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s been a book that&rsquo;s had more impact in my life. Reading Stephen Hawking&rsquo;s book made me realize that you can pull together all these topics you learn in high school &mdash; not just math and science, but also philosophy and religion. You realize the world is a cosmically big place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Lastly, with so many challenges in front of us as a world, what keeps you up at night?</strong></p><p>I think we are forgetting how to be kind and compassionate to one another. In 2018, it&rsquo;s much more fashionable to show outrage, to be critical. Even though I have worked for some groundbreaking social media companies, I think social media tends to amplify this trend by highlighting the loudest and the craziest among us. Compassion and kindness don&rsquo;t get the headlines. If we don&rsquo;t watch out, this trend can get away from us. If we can&rsquo;t work together and be kind and understanding to each other, I don&rsquo;t see how we&rsquo;re going to have a chance to fix our biggest problems.</p>  '),

The discovery raises the possibility that dogs may be able to pass the flu to people, perhaps setting off a pandemic.</p><p>About 15 percent of pet dogs that went to the vet because of respiratory infections <a href="http://mbio.asm.org/content/9/3/e00909-18">carried flu viruses often found in pigs</a>, researchers report June 5 in <em>mBio</em>. Of the virus strains detected, three have recombined in dogs to form new varieties.</p><p>That mixing generates genetic diversity in the viruses that makes them potentially a pandemic threat, says study coauthor Adolfo GarcÃ­a-Sastre, a virologist who directs the Global Health and Emerging Pathogens Institute of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.</p><p>Evolution of the flu viruses in dogs has been very rapid, occurring in just a few years, GarcÃ­a-Sastre says. Thereâ€™s no sign yet that the dog flu viruses can infect people, but that could change. â€œThe more diversity of viruses there is in an animal reservoir, the higher the chances that it will lead to a version of the virus that is able to jumpâ€ to humans, he says.</p><p>Pigs and birds remain the prime suspects for mixing up the next human pandemic influenza virus, says Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician at Johns Hopkins University and a spokesperson for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Even if a dog flu virus infected a person, the pathogen may not be able to transmit easily from person-to-person â€” an important characteristic a virus must have before it can circulate around the world.</p><p>But because most people encounter dog noses far more frequently than those of pigs, itâ€™s worth keeping an eye on the pups, Adalja says. â€œKnowing that dogs could contribute is important for preparing for the next pandemic, because we donâ€™t know exactly what that virus will be,â€ he says.</p><p>The first flu virus in dogs was discovered in 2005 in the United States. That pathogen, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/flu-horses-racing-among-dogs?mode=magazine&amp;context=197053">from a horse flu virus called H3N8 that had jumped to canines</a>, sometimes spreads among pooches in shelters (<em>SN: 10/8/05, p. 237</em>). And, in 2010, some dogs in Asia were found carrying a version of the H3N2 virus from birds. (Cats can catch the dog H3N2 flu virus, but donâ€™t transmit it to other cats, as far as scientists know.)</p><p>In the new study, the team swabbed the noses of 800 dogs in the Guangxi region of southern China from 2013 to 2015. All of the dogs had respiratory illnesses, but only 116 were infected with influenza viruses. To the scientistsâ€™ surprise, the dogs had various swine H1N1 flu viruses. The researchers determined the genetic makeup of 16 of the samples and discovered that some of these swine viruses had previously circulated in people and pigs in Europe and Asia. Some are strains of bird flu that have infected pigs.</p><p>In pigs, the viruses swapped genes among themselves, creating new varieties, some of which were passed to dogs. A virus genetically similar to one of the swine viruses passed to dogs was found in a person in China, raising the possibility that some swine flus can strike both pups and people. Dogs remixed some of the viruses from the pigs with bits of the dog flu virus in Asia, creating the three new canine influenza virus strains, the researchers found.</p><p>Since the study collected samples from only one part of China, the team doesnâ€™t know how widespread flu is among dogs, or how many canine-infecting influenzas may be out there.</p><p>Finding flu viruses in dogs isnâ€™t cause for alarm. But researchers should monitor the situation and use vaccines, quarantine and other infection-control methods to limit outbreaks and keep the canine viruses from catching hold in humans, GarcÃ­a-Sastre says.</p></span></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="field field-name-field-article-citation field-type-text-long field-label-above">       <div class="field-label">Citations</div>     <div class="field-items">           <div class="field-item even"><p>Y.

A hundred years later, scientists know much more about how to prevent and treat such diseases. But in some ways, the threat of a global outbreak is greater than ever. All it takes is one plane ride for a few localized cases of a disease to become an epidemic.</p><p>A new exhibit at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., traces the way infectious diseases still shape our world. The exhibit, called â€œ<a href="http://naturalhistory.si.edu/exhibits/outbreak/">Outbreak: Epidemics in a Connected World</a>,â€ is centered around the concept of One Health â€” the idea that the health of humans, other animals and the environment are all intertwined, so <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oral-vaccines-could-save-ethiopian-wolves-extinction?mode=topic&amp;context=76">protecting one requires protecting all</a> (<em>SN: 3/31/18, p. 20</em>).</p><p></p><div class="lz-cont">   <img src="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/05/060918_LH_exhibit_outbreak_inline_370.jpg?mode=topic&amp;context=76" data-echo="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/05/060918_LH_exhibit_outbreak_inline_370.jpg?mode=topic&amp;context=76" alt="" class="caption" style="float: right; width: 370px; height: 554px;" title="&lt;b&gt;ONE HEALTH&lt;/b&gt;Â Â â€œOutbreakâ€ explains how the health of humans and other animals are interconnected.

Tracking animal diseases before they jump to people is one way to prevent some future epidemics. ~~ James Di Loreto and Lucia RM Martino/Smithsonian Institution" /></noscript> </div> News coverage of disease outbreaks often focuses on the deaths they cause, notes Jonathan Epstein of EcoHealth Alliance, the exhibitâ€™s chief science adviser. One goal of the exhibit, he says, is â€œto give the public a look at how these things get started.â€ With that in mind, â€œOutbreakâ€ highlights a handful of epidemics that have occurred in the last century, using each as a jumping off point to explore different aspects of preventing, tracing, treating and containing infectious diseases.<p>In addition to zeroing in on epidemics that have made international headlines, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/year-review-science-faces-ebola-epidemic?mode=topic&amp;context=76">Ebola</a> and SARS, the exhibit features lesser-known diseases. Nipah virus, for instance, has infected people in Bangladesh who have drunk sweet date palm sap contaminated by infected bats. Simple preventive measures like encouraging people not to drink the raw sap or to filter it, so far, have prevented the virus from sparking an epidemic.</p><p>â€œOutbreakâ€ is more focused on text and interactive screens than on artifacts, which makes sense given the microscopic subjects. But the exhibit does draw on the Smithsonianâ€™s extensive collections, showcasing arrays of preserved infectious disease vectors, such as ticks and mosquitoes, as well as bat and macaque specimens. As these display cases explain, monitoring the health of animal populations helps researchers put preventive measures in place before emerging infectious diseases can jump to humans.</p><p>As an entry point for discussing the social side of disease and the stigma that infected people can face, a collection of buttons and signs from AIDS activists recalls the fight for public recognition and government action in the 1980s and â€™90s.</p><div class="inline-content inline-content-right clearfix"><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>â€œ<a href="http://naturalhistory.si.edu/exhibits/outbreak/">Outbreak</a>â€</strong></h4><div class="inline-content-copy"><h5 style="text-align: center;">Through 2021</h5><h5 style="text-align: center;">Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History |Â <em>Washington, D.C.</em></h5></div></div><p>The content on display might not be a good fit for very young children, but interactive games and activities throughout increase the exhibitâ€™s overall kid appeal. In one game, played on touch screens, players each pick from a variety of roles â€” such as epidemiologist, wildlife biologist or community worker â€” and then cooperate to complete tasks that stem the tide of a fictional outbreak. (Itâ€™s a good example of the broader message that stopping infectious diseases requires collaboration from many different kinds of experts.)</p><p>In case Washington isnâ€™t on your travel agenda, the Smithsonian is translating the content into multiple languages and sharing it with libraries, community centers and other institutions around the world to help them create their own pared-down versions of the exhibit.</p></span></div></div></div><span property="rnews:name schema:name" content="â€˜Outbreakâ€™ puts the life cycle of an epidemic on display" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>        ');

Instead, these four-footed creatures, which appeared about 375 million years ago, lived in the brackish waters of an estuary or delta, researchers report online May 30 in <em>Nature.</em></p><p>Early tetrapods, such as <em>Ichthyostega</em> and <em>Acanthostega,</em> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0159-2">lived an amphibious existence between land and sea</a>: They had feet, but also gills and tails made for swimming. A new study by paleontologist Jean Goedert of UniversitÃ© Lyon in France and colleagues suggests that the animals also could have tolerated rapid changes in salinity, such as is found in an estuary.</p><p>The researchers analyzed sulfur and oxygen isotopes â€” forms of these elements with the same number of protons, but different masses â€” in 51 fossilized tetrapod bones from locations in whatâ€™s now Greenland and China. Compared with freshwater, seawater has a higher ratio of the sulfur-34 isotope relative to sulfur-32. The tetrapod bones tended to show elevated sulfur-34, the researchers report, suggesting that the creatures spent at least some time in seawater. But oxygen isotope analyses of the bones show that freshwater was also present, arguing against a purely salty environment such as an ocean.</p><p>The results challenge a long-held view that the earliest tetrapods emerged from freshwaters, such as rivers or lakes. In 1929, the first <em>Ichthyostega</em> fossils were found in a series of red sandstone layers in eastern Greenland that geologists once thought had been deposited in a freshwater environment. But later discoveries of tetrapod fossils found associated with known marine species suggested that the early walkers may have lived in saltier waters than once thought.</p><p>An ability to tolerate different salinity environments could have helped tetrapods â€” a group that includes todayâ€™s amphibians, reptiles and mammals â€” survive a mass extinction of ocean-dwellers that occurred by the end of the Devonian Period about 359 million years ago, the researchers say.</p></span></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="field field-name-field-article-citation field-type-text-long field-label-above">       <div class="field-label">Citations</div>     <div class="field-items">           <div class="field-item even"><p>J.

He and colleagues used observations of the fossil, called <em>Megachirella wachtleri</em>, and of related living and extinct species plus genetic data <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0093-3">to reconstruct the evolutionary history of squamates</a>, the reptile group that today includes snakes and lizards, the researchers report in the May 31 <em>Nature</em>.</p><p>â€œUnderstanding lizard and snake evolution has been a constant problem in paleontology,â€ says vertebrate paleontologist Stephanie Pierce of Harvard University who worked on the issue years ago but wasnâ€™t involved in the new study. The trouble comes largely from a lack of relevant fossils, she says. That dearth isnâ€™t just because little animals donâ€™t fossilize as readily as big ones do. â€œThings like giant dinosaurs â€” theyâ€™re pretty easy to spot,â€ she says. â€œBut if youâ€™re looking for something that can fit in the palm of your hand, that makes it very challenging.â€</p><p></p><div class="lz-cont">   <img src="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/05/main/articles/053018_SM_lizard-fossil_inline_370.jpg?mode=magazine&amp;context=194583" data-echo="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/05/main/articles/053018_SM_lizard-fossil_inline_370.jpg?mode=magazine&amp;context=194583" alt="Megachirella wachtleri" class="caption" style="float: right; width: 370px; height: 483px;" title="&lt;b&gt;EARLY ITALIAN&lt;/b&gt;  The oldest known lizard &lt;em&gt;Megachirella wachtleri&lt;/em&gt; (seen in an artistâ€™s illustration) probably hunted insects among ancient plants in whatâ€™s now Italy. ~~ Davide Bonadonna " /><noscript><img src="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/05/main/articles/053018_SM_lizard-fossil_inline_370.jpg?mode=magazine&amp;context=194583" alt="Megachirella wachtleri" class="caption" style="float: right; width: 370px; height: 483px;" title="&lt;b&gt;EARLY ITALIAN&lt;/b&gt;  The oldest known lizard &lt;em&gt;Megachirella wachtleri&lt;/em&gt; (seen in an artistâ€™s illustration) probably hunted insects among ancient plants in whatâ€™s now Italy. ~~ Davide Bonadonna " /></noscript> </div> A collector found <em>M. wachtleri</em> almost 20 years ago in a part of the Italian Alps that had once been underwater. But researchers didnâ€™t categorize itÂ as a full member of the squamate branch of reptiles, until now. The sole specimen is partly embedded in rock, which obscured some of the creatureâ€™s telltale features. Now a CT scan has revealed previously unknown squamate details of its palate, braincase, limbs and shoulder, SimÃµes says.<p><em>M. wachtleri</em> was a small, terrestrial animal with teeth appropriate for snapping up insects, he says. Yet a catastrophe such as a tropical storm apparently swept it out to sea along with masses of leaves.</p><p>Besides taking a closer look at <em>M. wachtleri</em>, SimÃµes and some colleagues traveled to 17 countries from Brazil to China to reexamine the other known squamate fossils. Combining all of the new fossil measurements with DNA data, the researchers reconstructed the evolutionary tree of squamates. Among the new insights: Geckos appear to be the most ancient of still-surviving lizards, the team found. And iguanas, a hard-to-place group on the tree, have a more recent origin than some other studies have found.</p><p>â€œThe picture is coming together,â€ says study coauthor Oksana Vernygora, an evolutionary biologist also at the University of Alberta.</p><p>Previously, the oldest known squamate fossils dated back about to 168 million years ago. Adding <em>M. wachtleri</em> to the mix means that the squamates are so ancient that they arose before the mass extinction at the end of the Permian Period 252 million years ago, notes herpetologist and evolutionary biologist Jeff Streicher ofÂ the Natural History Museum in LondonÂ who was not involved in the study. That cataclysm came the closest (yet) to wiping out life on Earth. How the ancestors of modern lizards and snakes made it is still a matter of debate.</p></span></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="field field-name-field-article-citation field-type-text-long field-label-above">       <div class="field-label">Citations</div>     <div class="field-items">           <div class="field-item even"><p>T.R.

the planet, <strong>Alexandra Witze</strong> reported in â€œ<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/flying-insects-tell-tales-long-distance-migrations%5C?mode=topic&amp;context=43">Flying insects tell tales of long-distance migrations</a>â€ (</em>SN: 4/14/18, p. 22<em>). </em></p><p>â€œThere are several uncritical references to using pesticides to combat insect pestsâ€ in the story, reader <strong>Christina Gullion</strong> wrote.</p><p><strong>Gullion</strong> noted that pesticides can be harmful not just to pests, but also to the beneficial insects that provide crucial ecosystem services. â€œUse of pesticides is selecting for resistant pests, as well as an important factor in the decline of beneficial insect populations,â€ she wrote. â€œThis was not mentioned as one of the factors in their decline, yet it is the factor that is most easily within the control of growers and gardeners.â€ <strong>Gullion</strong> thought that <em>Science News</em> should report more on important developments in conservation and pest management in agriculture and horticulture.</p><div class="inline-content inline-content-right clearfix"><h4>Lost in translation</h4><div

Many readers wondered how Hawking radiation could cause a black hole to evaporate over time. â€œIt seems the black hole would be increasing in mass by the amount of energy contained in the particle it has just captured,â€ reader <strong>Larry Gioannini</strong> wrote.</p><p>A particle can escape only if its trapped partner has negative energy, <strong>Conover </strong>says. â€œWhen a black hole absorbs a negative energy particle, that particle actually takes away some of the black holeâ€™s energy,â€ she says. â€œBecause energy and mass are equivalent in physics, according to Einsteinâ€™s theory of special relativity, the black hole loses mass. So it will disappear if this process continues long enough.â€</p><h4><strong>Scientists get real</strong></h4><p><em>In her editorâ€™s note â€œ<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-many-scientists-do-you-know-real-life%5D?mode=topic&amp;context=43">How many scientists do you know in real life?</a>â€ (</em>SN: 4/14/18, p. 2<em>), </em>Science News <em>Editor in Chief <strong>Nancy Shute</strong> wrote that the scientific and science journalism communities have more work to do to connect the public with scientists. </em></p><p><strong>Shuteâ€™s</strong> note resonated with readers.</p><p>â€œGreat to see that the organization recognizes the separation between scientists and the general public,â€ reader <strong>Charles Martin</strong> wrote. â€œAlso great to see that <em>SN</em> recognizes that it is the scientific communityâ€™s place to change that. Presentations at schools are great but donâ€™t really reach the general public. <em>SN</em> issues are one way, but why not consider a â€˜know a scientistâ€™ program nationwide? Think of the possibilities.â€</p><p>The editorâ€™s note stirred up memories for reader <strong>Carolee Metcalfe Wende</strong>. She recalled explaining to her young son that his father, a solar physicist, was a â€œdoctor of the sun.â€ â€œMy sonâ€™s face lit up with this most wonderful news! I think for the next year or so, he thought that his awesome father had something to do with the sun rising every morning,â€ she wrote. <strong>Metcalfe Wende</strong>, a microbiologist, also recalled a plaster test-tube holder that her son made for her. â€œI had it with me at work every day for the rest of my career,â€ she wrote. â€œThank you so much for bringing it to peopleâ€™s attention that even though not all scientists are as notable as those mentioned in the article, we indeed are all around, all the time, living normal, everyday lives.â€</p></span></div></div></div><span property="rnews:name schema:name" content="Readers respond to pesticides, Hawking radiation and more" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>        '),

without skeletons. But since that innovation evolved about 550 million years ago, thereâ€™s been an evolutionary arms race of epic proportions.</p><p>One of the first competitors was <em>Cloudina</em>, a small seafloor creature whose exterior skeleton almost certainly evolved in response to predation: In well-preserved groups of fossils, up to a fifth of these crittersâ€™ exoskeletons show holes or other evidence of being attacked.</p><p>In the eras since, in response to predation and a wide range of other challenges, life has evolved a wild diversity of such structures, as described in the aptly named <em>Skeletons</em>. The book is another collaboration between paleobiologists Jan Zalasiewicz and Mark Williams, who previously wrote about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/%E2%80%98ocean-worlds%E2%80%99-chronicles-story-water-earth-and-across-cosmos?mode=topic&amp;context=76">oceans on Earth and other worlds</a> (<em>SN: 3/7/15, p. 29</em>). As the authors point out, skeletons now take many forms and sizes, including the tiny carbonate and silicate shells secreted by marine microplankton and the giant frames of blue whales. The authors even make the case that wood â€” a rigid, biologically built material â€” is a sort of skeleton.</p><p>Zalasiewicz and Williams survey the various functions of skeletons. Exoskeletons, like those of <em>Cloudina</em>, often serve purposes besides body armor, acting as anchors for a creatureâ€™s muscles and other tissues. For the first animals that left the seas (and for many creatures living in arid environments today), an exoskeleton helped prevent desiccation.</p><p>External skeletons do have their disadvantages. For one thing, an animal like a spider or scorpion thatâ€™s fully enclosed in an exoskeleton must occasionally shed its armor as the animal grows, which temporarily leaves the creature vulnerable.</p><p>Taking another route, vertebrate animals evolved to grow their skeletons on the inside of the body. Some species, like whales and elephants, can grow to immense proportions but have had to develop different means of defending themselves.</p><p>Zalasiewicz and Williams donâ€™t limit their survey to biological scaffolding.

But maybe itâ€™s better not to get too dependent on them if you want to survive a big flaming space object crashing into Earth.</p><p>The asteroid impact that caused a mass extinction 66 million years probably also triggered the collapse of forests worldwide, a new investigation of the plant fossil record concludes. Needing trees and extensive plant cover for nesting or food could have been a fatal drawback for winged dinosaurs, including some ancient birds. Reconstructing the ecology of ancient birds suggests that modern fowl descended from species that survived because <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2018.04.062">they could live on the ground</a>, an international research team proposes in the June 4 <em>Current Biology</em>.</p><p>â€œYou probably would have died anyway regardless of habitat,â€ says study coauthor Daniel Field, an evolutionary paleobiologist at the University of Bath in England. â€œBut if you could get along on the ground, you at least had a shot at surviving across this devastated landscape.â€</p><p>The shock wave from the strike probably flattened trees within a radius of 1,500 kilometers, Field says. Wildfires ignited around the planet and then came the acid rain. Clouds of ash and dust may have darkened the sky for several years, and researchers suspect that photosynthesis waned. Yet some lucky birds, but no other dinosaurs, survived the hellscape.</p><p>For clues to what made a survivor, researchers turned to fossilized pollen from before and after the fiery impact. Abundant kinds of flower-bearing and cone-bearing plants left pollen just before the asteroid hit and again starting about a thousand years afterward. In between those times of diversity, however, ferns dominated, the team notes. A kind of â€œdisaster flora,â€ ferns (making spores instead of flowers and seeds) do well at recolonizing land. Seed plants, however, werenâ€™t thriving.</p><p>Analyzing evolutionary histories of modern birds supports the idea of tree dependence as a vulnerability for the earliest fowl, the researchers say. Specialists in bird evolution now generally agree on the lowest, oldest branches of the bird family tree, Field says. The bottommost one, for instance, includes such modern species as ground-dwelling ostriches and smaller, flight-capable birds called tinamous, which might be more like the ancient birds that dodged extinction.</p><p>Working backward along these low branches, researchers used fossils and known bird traits to reconstruct the most likely lifestyles of the earliest survivors. These probably werenâ€™t tree-dependent birds, the researchers conclude.</p><p>The glory days of dinosaurs had had plenty of flying tree-dwellers. So far, paleontologists have identified at least 80 kinds of what are called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/some-lucky-birds-escaped-dino-doomsday?mode=magazine&amp;context=194583">â€œopposite birds,â€</a> the Enantiornithes <em>(SN: 2/4/17, p. 26)</em>. â€œIf you saw one flying around today, youâ€™d say, â€˜Well, thatâ€™s a bird,â€™ â€ Field explains. Their feet looked like those of birds that perch on tree limbs, so heâ€™s not surprised that a fossil of an opposite bird from this probably arboreal group has never been found in rock formed after the dino doomsday.</p><p>What did happen, however, was that when trees and forests came back after the disaster, birds quickly evolved arboreal lifestyles, the team says.</p><p>Many people donâ€™t realize that birds almost died off during the mass extinction, too, says paleontologist Stephen Brusatte of the University of Edinburgh who has studied bird evolution but was not involved in the new study. What let the few survivors squeak through, he says, has been a mystery for a long time. The whole scenario of a ground-dwellerâ€™s advantage and then a return to the trees â€œmakes a lot of intuitive sense.â€</p></span></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="field field-name-field-article-citation field-type-text-long field-label-above">       <div class="field-label">Citations</div>     <div class="field-items">           <div class="field-item even"><p>D.J.

set off tsunamis and wildfires before <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dino-dooming-asteroid-impact-created-chilling-sulfur-cloud?mode=topic&amp;context=76">climate-chilling clouds of sulfur gas engulfed the planet</a> for decades, wiping out most life (<em>SN: 11/25/17, p. 14</em>). As these clouds dissipated, billions of tons of carbon dioxide, which spewed into the atmosphere when the asteroid hit, fueled roughly 100,000 years of global warming, new data suggest. Analyzing fossilized fish bits hints that the influx of the greenhouse gas <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aap8525">raised the temperature of the ocean on average by 5 degrees Celsius</a>, scientists report online May 24 in <em>Science</em>.</p><p>Itâ€™s not surprising that the climate heated up after the collision, which left a 200-kilometer-wide crater centered around whatâ€™s now Chicxulub, Mexico, says Johan Vellekoop, a geologist at KU Leuven in Belgium. But finding evidence to back up the warming claim has been challenging.</p><p>A common way to estimate past temperatures on Earth is to measure the proportion of heavier to lighter forms of oxygen in the carbonate shells left behind by dead invertebrates. Animals incorporate different oxygen forms into shells, teeth and bones at different rates depending on temperature. But carbonate fossils from around the time of the impact arenâ€™t well enough preserved to be a reliable thermometer.</p><p>Instead, paleogeologist Ken MacLeod of the University of Missouri in Columbia and colleagues analyzed those same types of oxygen ratios in a crushed jumble of fish bones, teeth and scales â€” a different way to measure past temperatures. The team collected sediment samples from a section of rock in whatâ€™s now El Kef, Tunisia, that records the transition between the periods before and after the impact in its layers. (Samples from 2 meters of rock laid down before the impact and 6.6 meters laid down after the strike recorded almost 250,000 years of geologic history.)

That change translates to an increase in seawater temperature of about 5 degrees Celsius â€” a substantial amount.</p><p>The elevated temperatures persisted for about 100,000 years before the planet cooled down again, an analysis of fish debris collected from different levels of rock showed. While the study looked only at ocean temperature, air temperature would probably reflect that increase, too, MacLeod says.</p><p>â€œItâ€™s a pretty robust result,â€ says Clay Tabor, a climate scientist at the University of Connecticut in Hartford. But getting similar results from sites elsewhere in the world would boost the case that this was a global effect and not a local fluke, he says.</p><p>The story is far from over, MacLeod agrees. Itâ€™s not clear how long after the impact the warming began, for instance. His team hopes to analyze fish debris from other sites that might reveal finer-scale changes in temperature.Â </p></span></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="field field-name-field-article-citation field-type-text-long field-label-above">       <div class="field-label">Citations</div>     <div class="field-items">           <div class="field-item even"><p>K.G.

Female bystanders also gestured as if ready to hold an infant before it was born, or actually held one as it was born, scientists report online May 9 in <em>Evolution and Human Behavior</em>. Ethologist Elisa Demuru of the Natural History Museum of the University of Pisa in Italy and colleagues filmed these incidents in 2009, 2012 and 2014 at two European primate parks where the apes roam freely through forested areas.</p><p>These observations, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10329-014-0436-0">along with a 2014 report of wild bonobos behaving similarly</a>, challenge an influential idea that human females, unlike other primates, receive birth assistance. Scientists had proposed that the perils of passing a baby through the relatively narrow human birth canal called for help from others. But bonobos can safely give birth on their own, so something else is at work here, Demuru and colleagues suspect. Comparably high levels of sociability among female bonobos and among women may instead explain why helpers assemble as a pregnant individual nears delivery.</p><p>Chimpanzees, close cousins of bonobos, are a different story. Female chimps are more competitive and maintain weaker social bonds than female bonobos or humans do.

Plants often look helpless to a human, but they fight with smells and other invisible chemistry. A growing body of evidence, for example, shows that plants under attack can waft out scents that attract help, such as tiny wasps that deal a lingering death to leaf-chewing caterpillars.</p><p>A dream for future farming is to boost such crop powers. Yet a tale, published May 16 in <em>Science Advances</em>, of how <em>Spodoptera littoralis </em>caterpillars <a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/5/eaar4767">can escape a trap set for them by maize plants</a> shows how complex a task that could be.</p><p>These attackers are â€œgreenish, brownish, ugly caterpillars,â€ says Ted Turlings of the University of NeuchÃ¢tel in Switzerland, who makes no secret of where his allegiance lies. The caterpillars damage maize, cotton and a variety of other crops in the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere. But maize fights back, of course. As the caterpillars crunch into a leaf, substances in their spit trigger a burst of furious plant chemistry, which causes the release of certain scents.</p><p>The first wave of odors from damaged plants, the cut-grass smell, comes just from ripped tissues spilling their innards. Then within hours, maize sends out new scents that can advertise the kind of pests attacking it. â€œYou can actually smell it yourself,â€ Turlings says. Or at least his trained nose can.</p><p>These telltale plant substances help female <em>Microplitis rufiventris</em> wasps track down a suitable species of fresh caterpillar flesh. The females cruise for caterpillars as sites for injecting an egg. â€œOut of that egg comes a little larva, and it starts eating the insides of the caterpillar â€” not a very pleasant thing,â€ Turlings says. Caterpillars continue feeding for several days but then just passively stay alive longer as a source of fresh baby food.</p><p>What Turlings and his colleagues have found, however, is that what the caterpillar eats makes a difference. Wasps were more interested in caterpillars grazing on maize that researchers genetically engineered not to produce a plant defense compound called indole. In contrast, wasps werenâ€™t very likely to inject eggs if this caterpillar species had been feeding on normal maize leaves.</p><div class="inline-content inline-content-left clearfix" style="width:100%; float:none;"><h4>Smell the leaves</h4><div class="inline-content-copy"><div class="image-desktop"><div class="lz-cont">   <img src="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/05/051818_SM_plant-chem-defenses_inline_730_REV_2.png?mode=magazine&amp;context=194583" data-echo="https://www.sciencenews.org/sites/default/files/2018/05/051818_SM_plant-chem-defenses_inline_730_REV_2.png?mode=magazine&amp;context=194583" alt="" class="caption" style="width: 730px; height: 395px;" title="~~ T.C.J.

When caterpillars first bite into a maize leaf, though, a wave of leafy green volatiles rise (middle graph). In a matter of hours, the leaf synthesizes other volatiles, including a compound called indole, that together offer more specific clues to the kind of attacker (bottom graph). These releases lure such caterpillar enemies as a female parasitoid wasp.</p></div></div><p>Indoleâ€™s â€œmothball-like odor [is] terrible in high dosages,â€ Turlings says. Caterpillars didnâ€™t like it much either â€” except when female wasps were zinging around them. Then the caterpillars fed willingly enough, a test showed. â€œItâ€™s almost like self-medicating,â€ he says.</p><p>Thereâ€™s a cost to the caterpillarsâ€™ choice to consume indole-rich foliage. â€œThey grow fatter but not healthier,â€ Turlings says. More die prematurely. On the plus side, wasp eggs donâ€™t flourish as well inside these caterpillars if a wasp does try to use them as zombified baby food. The odor of pure indole could attract the wasps, but caterpillars bulked up on indole-rich leaves did not, the researchers found in lab tests. This caterpillarâ€™s feeding evolution had found a loophole in maizeâ€™s defense strategy.</p><p>Just about every plant tested so far synthesizes special compounds that can lure in some kinds of natural enemies of pests, Turlings says. Yet heâ€™d never run across a caterpillar with this bad-food strategy of avoiding the wasps.</p><p>Caterpillars evolving a work-around defense against a widespread plant defense donâ€™t shock chemical ecologist James Tumlinson of Penn State University. In these ornate biological systems of deceit and manipulation, â€œpretty much anything you can think of is possible,â€ he says. Â â€œOnce we get over our surprise, it nearly always makes evolutionary sense.â€</p> <style type="text/css"> <!--/*--><![CDATA[/* ><!--*/ .image-mobile {     display: none;   }   @media (max-width: 400px) {     .image-mobile {       display: block;     }     .image-desktop {       display: none;     }   }  /*--><!]]>*/ </style></span></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="field field-name-field-article-citation field-type-text-long field-label-above">       <div class="field-label">Citations</div>     <div class="field-items">           <div class="field-item even"><p>M.
